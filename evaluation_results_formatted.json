Is there a cap on the max number of agents?\r\nAnswer: Based on our current data, the average speed of migration scales linearly to the number of agents, unless the overall throughput hits the upper limit of your network bandwidth. Multiple agents reading from the same source file share path can also impact throughput. There\u2019s no limit on how many agents you can install. We have many customers who perform migrations using 20+ agents. **Note:** A single agent can process up to 10 tasks at a given time.\r\n**Question:** Where are local Migration Manager logs stored?\r\nAnswer: The logs are stored here: `C:\\Users\\<Username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\SPMigration`.\r\n**Question:** Can I rename my temporary working folder?\r\nAnswer: Yes. By default the name of the folder is `%appdata%\\Microsoft\\SPMigration`. Through the Migration Manager UI, you can configure the physical location of the folder where logs and reports are stored on the agent's machine including renaming your working folder.\r\n**Question:** What should I do if I don't have enough storage space?\r\nAnswer: When you are in Manager Manager, you can see the available disc space. Choose a drive that has enough storage before starting your migration.\r\n**Question:** What happen during incremental migration if I rename, move or delete a destination file or folder?\r\nAnswer: After a file or fold is migrated to destination, user **renames or moves** the file or folder, then remigrate,\r\n- The source file or folder is migrated to the destination.\r\n- The renamed/moved file or folder is kept.\r\nAfter a file or folder is migrated to destination, user **deletes** the file or folder, then remigrate,\r\n- The source file or folder is migrated to the destination.\r\n**Question:** In file share migrations, what is the content type of a migrated document?\n\n--- [Chunk 2 | Source: mm-faqs.md] ---\n**Question:** Is there a Tenant to Tenant (T2T) migration solution?\r\nAnswer: Yes. Cross-tenant OneDrive migration is now available outside of Migration Manager. A cross tenant migration solution for **SharePoint** is currently available. [Learn more about the cross-tenant OneDrive migration](/microsoft-365/enterprise/cross-tenant-onedrive-migration).\r\n**Question:** Can I migrate content from SharePoint Server?\r\nAnswer: At this time, Migration Manager supports the migration of file shares and cloud sources including Google, Dropbox, and Box. It doesn't support the migration of content from SharePoint Server. See SPMT (SharePoint Migration Tool) for SharePoint Server migration.\r\n**Question:** Can I run the SharePoint Migration Tool (SPMT) on the same computer that I have the Migration Manager agent installed?\r\nAnswer: Yes.\r\n**Question:** Is multifactor authentication supported by Migration Manager?\r\nAnswer: Microsoft multifactor authentication is supported; however third party multifactor authentication isn't.\r\n**Question:** Can Migration Manager migrate content to non-English SharePoint sites?\r\nAnswer: Yes, Migration Manager can migrate content to non-English sites as long as the site title doesn\u2019t include non-EN characters.\r\n**Question:** Is Migration Manager available for Government clouds?\r\nAnswer: Yes. Here's how you configure it: [Government cloud settings](./mm-gov-cloud.md).\r\n**Question:** What\u2019s the retention policy for the blog storage?\r\nAnswer: Customers and ISVs use the [SharePoint-provided blob containers/queues](/sharepoint/dev/apis/migration-api-azure-container-and-queue) when they used the Migration API. [SAS URIs](/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview) are provided to access the container and queues. The SAS URIs are valid for three days from creation for containers and 21 days for queues. After the SAS expires, the content in the blob containers and queues isn't accessible.\n\n--- [Chunk 3 | Source: mm-faqs.md] ---\na migration. There are many factors that prevent migration impacting site performance:\r\n- Migration runs as a background activity and doesn't compete with end-user traffic.\r\n- SharePoint and OneDrive infrastructure has built-in throttling rules that project the reliability and availability of the system. To learn more about migration throughput and factors that affect migration speed, learn more at: [General migration performance guidance](./sharepoint-online-and-onedrive-migration-speed.md).\r\n**Question:** Does Migration Manager do incremental migrations?\r\nAnswer: Yes. The jobs created in Migration Manager do perform incremental migrations.\r\n**Question:** The date and time in Migration Manager isn't my local time. How can I change the setting to my local time zone?\r\nAnswer: Migration Manager uses the time zone setting in the SharePoint Admin center to convert to your time zone. To update the timezone of the SharePoint Admin Center, browse to `https://<your host url>-admin.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/regionalsetng.aspx` to change the setting.\r\n**Question:** What does **% complete** mean?\r\nAnswer: The % complete indicates the progress of the overall task migration, including the number of files migrated and the preparation work required for the remaining files to be migrated. *Note:* The **%** isn't linearly proportional to the number of files remaining to be migrated.\r\n**Question:** What is the maximum file size that can be migrated?\r\nAnswer: For file share and cloud migrations, a file size of 250 GB is supported.\r\n**Question**: How many task rows can I run at once when migrating content from a cloud provider?\r\nAnswer: At a maximum, only 50 task rows can run simultaneously. This total includes both scanning and migrating. This limit doesn't apply to file share migration.\r\n**Question:** In the Migration Manager tool, is there a limit to the number of path characters you can enter?\r\nAnswer: Yes.\n\n--- [Chunk 4 | Source: mm-faqs.md] ---\n**Question:** Does the file share I'm migrating need to be on a Windows computer?\r\nAnswer: No. As long as you can access the file share from the migration agent, you can migrate it.\r\n**Question:** Can I manually assign a task to a migration agent I set up?\r\nAnswer: No. Migration Manager does it for you by automatically distributing tasks to the next available agent. However, you can target migration tasks to a group of agents.\r\n**Question:** How many tasks can an agent perform simultaneously?\r\nAnswer: An agent can perform 5 to 10 tasks simultaneously, depending on the size of each of the tasks.\r\n**Question:** What happens when you \"pause\" a task?\r\nAnswer: Pausing a task doesn't release the agent to another task. The agent remains unavailable to accept a new task until the task is resumed and completed, or if the task is deleted.\r\n**Question:** How long does an agent stay connected to Migration Manager?\r\nAnswer: The connection between an agent and Migration Manager stays active as long as the computer is still running and the SharePoint admin credentials that were used to sign into the agent are still valid. If the agent does becomes disconnected, the agent holds the token to the Migration Manager for up to seven days. After which the agent needs to be reinstalled.\r\n**Question:** How do I remove the Migration Manager agent from a computer? \r\nAnswer: Rerun the Migration Manager agent installer and select the **Uninstall** button.\r\n**Question:** How do I update the Migration Manager agent?\r\nAnswer: The agent is set to automatically update to the latest version by default.\r\n**Question:** Does adding more agents linearly increase the throughput? Is there a cap on the max number of agents?\r\nAnswer: Based on our current data, the average speed of migration scales linearly to the number of agents, unless the overall throughput hits the upper limit of your network bandwidth. Multiple agents reading from the same source file share path can also impact throughput.\n\n--- [Chunk 5 | Source: identify-users-and-analyze-document-usage.md] ---\n<a name=\"section1\"> </a>\r\nTo identify the stakeholders and participants in your document management solution, you can use a survey to collect information.

Ensure all sites and content are well managed governed by site owners.\r\n- **Prevent content oversharing and control content access**: Use tools available to SharePoint admins and site owners to prevent users from oversharing content.

Make sure the information Copilot access is accurate and up to date.\n\n--- [Chunk 3 | Source: create-sharepoint-site-ownership-policy.md] ---\nDifferent organizations have different needs. Site ownership policies allow you to customize how ownership is determined by allowing you to:\r\n- Choose who is considered responsible for managing a site in your organization - site owners or site admins or both.  \r\n- Define the minimum number of owners or admins a site should have, currently up to 2.\r\nThe policy identifies all sites that aren't compliant with the configured ownership criteria and generate the report. If your policy is active, email notifications would then be sent for identified sites.  \r\nWe recommend choosing 2 as the minimum owner count so that sites with a single owner are identified and another owner is added immediately.

Inactive sites often contain obsolete content that can negatively impact Copilot\u2019s responses, leading to less relevant or incorrect results for users. Use the [Inactive Site policy](/sharepoint/site-lifecycle-management#create-an-inactive-site-policy) to identify sites that haven't been accessed for a specified period. Notify site owners and site admins to review these sites and decide whether to archive them, ensuring that Copilot only draws from current, relevant, and active content.\n\n--- [Chunk 2 | Source: get-ready-copilot-sharepoint-advanced-management.md] ---\nIdentify inactive sites, then take action to reduce your governance footprint and improve Copilot response quality. Inactive sites often contain outdated content, cluttering Copilot\u2019s data source and leading to less accurate responses. Removing these sites helps Copilot focus on current information for better results. Currently, you can identify unused sites by running an inactive site policy and ask site owners to attest if the site is still needed.\r\n- With less than five minutes you can set up and run an [Inactive Site policy](/sharepoint/site-lifecycle-management#create-an-inactive-site-policy) in Simulation mode to identify sites that haven't been accessed for an extended (configurable) period of time.\r\n- Once the report is generated, select the Get AI insights button to [get AI insights](/sharepoint/advanced-management#ai-insights) generated for the report to help you identify issues with the sites and possible actions to address these issues.\r\n- After identifying inactive sites, set the policy to Active mode to notify the Site Owner to attest whether the site is still needed.\r\n- If the site owners confirm the sites aren't needed, you need to put the sites either in [read-only mode](/sharepoint/site-lifecycle-management#read-only-mode). These sites will be moved to [Microsoft 365 Archive](/microsoft-365/archive/archive-overview) after a configurable duration (3, 6, 9, or 12 months). \r\n> [!TIP]\r\n> Sites moved to Microsoft 365 Archive are no longer accessible by anyone in the organization outside of Microsoft Purview or admin search. This means Copilot won't include content from these sites when responding to user prompts.\n\n--- [Chunk 3 | Source: site-lifecycle-management.md] ---\nThe site lifecycle management features from [Microsoft SharePoint Advanced Management](/sharepoint/advanced-management) let you improve site governance by having automated policies configured in the [SharePoint admin center](get-started-new-admin-center.md). Inactive site policies, part of SharePoint's site lifecycle management features, help you automate this process. You can set up an inactive site policy to automatically detect inactive sites and notify site owners via email. Owners can then confirm if the site is still active.\n\n--- [Chunk 4 | Source: advanced-management.md] ---\nYou can run automated, rule-based policies to manage and reduce inactive sites with the [**Inactive SharePoint sites policy**](site-lifecycle-management.md) feature from SharePoint Advanced Management.\r\nThe inactive sites policy combats content sprawl by automatically identifying and managing inactive SharePoint sites. It operates by defining inactivity criteria, such as lack of updates or user activity over a set period. Once identified, site owners receive email notifications to confirm the active/inactive state of the site.\n\n--- [Chunk 5 | Source: site-lifecycle-management.md] ---\nNotifications inform SharePoint site owners or site admins when a site is inactive for a specified number of months. To keep the site, the notification recipients should select the **Certify site** button in the notification email. Once certified, Site lifecycle management doesn't check the site's activity for one year.",

Brand assets are the things that give your brand its distinctive look, sound, and feel. They include your logo, colors, fonts, images, voice, and guidelines. You use your brand assets to show your brand personality and style in all the places where you communicate with your customers, such as websites, social media, marketing materials, presentations, and products. When you use your brand assets well, you make your brand more memorable, trustworthy, and unique.\r\nOne of the challenges of managing brand assets is to ensure consistency and quality across different platforms and devices. You want your brand to look sharp and professional everywhere, without spending too much time and effort on resizing, formatting, or providing appropriate access to your users.\r\nThe SharePoint brand center makes the management of brand assets simple across the Microsoft 365 product ecosystem. This centralized management system enables both asset management along with customization for how the assets are utilized within each product.\n\n--- [Chunk 4 | Source: brand-center-overview.md] ---\nThe SharePoint brand center includes two levels of management: the Microsoft 365 Admin Center and the Brand Center associated SharePoint site. Within the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, the global administrator has control over the enablement of the Brand Center and easy access to the associated site with management in the SharePoint Admin Center.\r\nFrom the Brand center associated site, [SharePoint site owners](/sharepoint/site-permissions#site-owners) and [above](/sharepoint/site-permissions) can update the site permissions in the SharePoint Admin Center such as adding more brand managers to the experience. You can do this by adding members to the site owners\u2019 group.

If you use ADM to manage your sync app policies, import the new files as you normally would in order to see the new setting.\r\nIf you're using other management systems to deploy policies to your users' Windows PCs, use the equivalent of the following command to prevent B2B Sync:\r\n```cmd\r\nreg add \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\OneDrive\" /v BlockExternalSync /t REG_DWORD /d 1\r\n```\r\nOn a Mac with the Apple Store version of OneDrive, use the equivalent of the following command to prevent B2B Sync:\r\n```cmd\r\ndefaults write com.microsoft.OneDrive-mac BlockExternalSync -bool YES\r\n```\r\nOn a Mac with the Standalone version of OneDrive, use the equivalent of the following command to prevent B2B Sync:\r\n```cmd\r\ndefaults write com.microsoft.OneDrive BlockExternalSync -bool YES\r\n```\n\n--- [Chunk 4 | Source: b2b-sync.md] ---\nSites and folders can be shared in different ways in SharePoint and OneDrive:\r\n- If users are syncing a folder, they can right-click it in File Explorer to share it.\r\n- Users can go to the SharePoint site or folder on the web and select the Share button to share it.\r\n- Users can share sites and folders in the SharePoint and OneDrive mobile apps.\r\n- Admins can create guest accounts and use the admin center or PowerShell to add them to sites.\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> For more info about these methods, see [Learn how to share a site](https://support.office.com/article/958771a8-d041-4eb8-b51c-afea2eae3658) and [Learn how to share a folder](https://support.office.com/article/1fe37332-0f9a-4719-970e-d2578da4941c).\r\nB2B Sync works with all these methods of sharing. It has only the following requirements:\r\n- For guests to sync shared content, the content must be shared at the site or folder level. Guests can't sync files that are shared individually (for example, from the Office apps).\r\n- B2B sync works only when guest accounts are created in the organization, and when the recipient has a Microsoft Entra account. It doesn't work when users share by creating an Anyone link (also known as \"anonymous access\" link), or when they share with people who have a Microsoft account or other personal account.\n\n--- [Chunk 5 | Source: b2b-sync.md] ---\nAs an admin in Microsoft 365, you can share with people outside the organization by [creating guests individually in the Microsoft Entra admin center](/azure/active-directory/b2b/b2b-quickstart-add-guest-users-portal), and then adding them to a SharePoint team site individually or by adding them to a security group that already has permissions to the site you want to share.

This scenario is often referred to as Business-to-Business (B2B) Collaboration.\r\nMicrosoft Entra guest accounts play a key role in making B2B Collaboration possible. A guest account at one organization links to a member account at another organization. Once created, a guest account allows Microsoft 365 services like OneDrive and SharePoint to grant a guest permission to sites and folders the same way a member within the organization is granted permission. Since the accounts at two organizations are linked, the user only needs to remember the username and password for the account at their organization.

It has only the following requirements:\r\n- For guests to sync shared content, the content must be shared at the site or folder level. Guests can't sync files that are shared individually (for example, from the Office apps).\r\n- B2B sync works only when guest accounts are created in the organization, and when the recipient has a Microsoft Entra account. It doesn't work when users share by creating an Anyone link (also known as \"anonymous access\" link), or when they share with people who have a Microsoft account or other personal account.\n\n--- [Chunk 2 | Source: b2b-sync.md] ---\n- Sync between users in different clouds isn't supported For example, content shared from a tenant in Microsoft Azure China 21Vianet isn't synched for a user with a Microsoft Azure Commercial cloud.\r\n- On the Mac, Files On-Demand thumbnails won't display from external organization's sites. Thumbnails display correctly for files from the user's own organization.\r\n- On the Mac, if the guest account was created with a different email address format than the form they're using with the sync app, the external site's content can't be synced. For example, <first.last@fabrikam.com> vs <alias@fabrikam.com>.\r\n- On Mac, the external content can be placed on the local computer in the user's own organization's folder instead of one with the external organization's name.\r\n- Interactive authentication UI for guest accounts from an external organization isn't supported by the sync client.\n\n--- [Chunk 3 | Source: b2b-sync.md] ---\nThe tenant admin can enable several kinds of conditional access policies at their tenant. When a guest is going to access a tenant's content, those policies may need to be adjusted for the guests so they can gain access.\r\n- Currently the sync client doesn't support interactive authentication UI when syncing external content. Any policy that would require a sign-in UI such as MFA (multifactor authentication) or TOU (terms of use) prompt, will prevent the syncing of the external content from that tenant. If a tenant admin deploys such a policy before a guest starts syncing from that tenant, the user is unable to establish the sync relationship. If the policy is deployed after a guest is syncing content from the tenant, that guest will receive an error and be unable to continue to sync from the tenant.\r\n- Tenants may update their Terms of Use (TOU) from time to time. A policy can trigger the user to view and accept the updated TOU via an interactive authentication prompt. Since sync doesn't support external tenant sign-in UI, sync indicates it's unable to sync the external site's content.\r\n- Device Compliance requires user machines to be managed by the tenant and then to be up to date with requirements. For guests, their machines are likely to be managed by their own organization and thus are incompatible with requiring their machines to be managed by the content sharing tenant.\r\n- Location-based conditional access policies are typically used to enforce more requirements like MFA when the user isn't connecting from a trusted location (such as the tenant's office network). Typically in a guest scenario the client machine won't be located at the trusted locations, and since sync doesn't support MFA, you likely don't want this policy to apply to your guests.\r\nFor more information, see [Authentication and Conditional Access for External Identities](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/authentication-conditional-access).\n\n--- [Chunk 4 | Source: b2b-sync.md] ---\nIn order for users at your organization to be able to share with their partners at other organizations, external sharing must be enabled at the organization level. To do this, you must be a global or SharePoint admin in Microsoft 365. After you enable external sharing at the organization level, you can restrict it site by site. A site's settings can be the same as the organization setting, or more restrictive, but not more permissive.\r\nYou can change your organization-level sharing settings in two different places (both control the same thing):\r\n- On the Sharing page in the new SharePoint admin center. For more info, see [Change the organization-level external sharing setting](/sharepoint/turn-external-sharing-on-or-off#change-the-organization-level-external-sharing-setting)\r\n- In the Microsoft 365 admin center, on the Org settings page > SharePoint.\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> If you allow Anyone links (sometimes referred to as \"anonymous access\" links), these links don't create guest accounts and therefore the external share recipient won't be able to use B2B Sync when receiving that link type.\r\nFor more info, see [External sharing overview](/sharepoint/external-sharing-overview).\n\n--- [Chunk 5 | Source: use-group-policy.md] ---\nThe B2B Sync feature of the OneDrive sync app lets users at an organization to sync OneDrive and SharePoint libraries and folders shared with them from another organization. For more information, see [B2B Sync](b2b-sync.md).\r\nEnabling this setting prevents users at your organization from being able to use B2B Sync. After the setting is enabled (by entering value 1) on a computer, the sync app doesn't sync libraries and folders shared from other organizations. Modify the setting to the disabled state (by entering value 0) to restore B2B Sync capability for your users.\r\nPrevent B2B Sync with:\r\n`[HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\OneDrive] \"BlockExternalSync\"=dword:1`\r\nRestore B2B Sync with:\r\n`[HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\OneDrive] \"BlockExternalSync\"=dword:0`",

Even if you later added a custom domain, the original onmicrosoft.com domain is used for all your SharePoint and OneDrive URLs. \r\nIf your organization is going through a rebranding, merger, or acquisition and needs to change the domain in your SharePoint and OneDrive URLs, you can change the domain name using PowerShell. For example, if your organization name changed from Contoso to Fabrikam, you can change your SharePoint URLs from `contoso.sharepoint.com` to `fabrikam.sharepoint.com`.\r\n> [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=929a7177-9508-4970-b74f-4ff19627f2ca]\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> - When the rename operation begins, all sites in the tenant are queued for individual renames to the new domain. While the renaming is happening, sites that are on the original domain would be temporarily inaccessible. Once each site is renamed to the new domain, it becomes accessible again.\r\n> - The standard version of the renaming feature is currently available to organizations that have no more than 10,000 total sites, which includes SharePoint sites, OneDrive accounts and SharePoint Embedded containers combined. \r\n> - Advanced Tenant Rename is available to organizations with any number of sites, available with SharePoint Advanced Management. See [Advanced Tenant Rename](change-your-sharepoint-domain-name.md#advanced-tenant-rename).\r\n> - The domain name change affects only SharePoint and OneDrive URLs. It doesn't impact email addresses.\r\n> - For info about changing a site address, for example, from `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/sample1` to  `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/sample2`, see [Change a site address](change-site-address.md). \r\n> - The domain rename feature isn't available for organizations that have set up multi-geo.

This includes those that had enabled a trial or the paid offering in the past. \r\n> - If your organization uses special clouds or government clouds (GCC, GCC High, DoD, etc.), or still has a .de domain, your domain name can't be changed.\r\n> - When you rename your SharePoint domain, we create a redirect at the previous address, which will expire 1 year after the rename.\r\n> - You can only rename your SharePoint domain once. If you need more renames, submit a support request by selecting [Rename a SharePoint Tenant more than once](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/?searchSolutions=Rename%20a%20SharePoint%20Tenant%20more%20than%20once).\r\n> - Changing your SharePoint domain name back to the original name after you rename it isn't supported. For example, if you change your SharePoint domain from `contoso.sharepoint.com` to `fabrikam.sharepoint.com`, changing it back to `contoso.sharepoint.com` isn't supported.\r\n> - A redirect site is created for each site rename and each redirect takes 0.15 MB. So, an organization should readily have '0.15MB * no. of sites' amount of storage available on the tenant before they rename.\n\n--- [Chunk 5 | Source: change-your-sharepoint-domain-name.md] ---\n1. Check the availability of the new domain you want. For example, if you want your SharePoint and OneDrive URLs to begin with `fabrikam.sharepoint.com`, enter `https://fabrikam.sharepoint.com` in a browser. If you get a message that the address couldn\u2019t be found (404), it's probably available. If you get a sign-in screen or a message that your username couldn\u2019t be found in the fabrikam.sharepoint.com directory, then the domain is taken and you need to try a different one. If the domain is already registered by another customer, we can't provide any information or contact the customer. \r\n    -or-\r\n    If you own the domain for another subscription, you need to [delete that tenant in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/directory-delete-howto). Deleting a tenant typically takes three days to complete and to make the domain available. \r\n    > [!WARNING]\r\n    > Do NOT use the domain to test this procedure in a test environment first. If you do, you won't be able to use the domain for your production environment.\r\n2. Add your [new .onmicrosoft.com domain using the Domains page in the M365 Admin Center](/microsoft-365/admin/setup/add-or-replace-your-onmicrosoftcom-domain#add-a-new-onmicrosoftcom-domain). \r\n     - Don't use the \"Add domain\" option directly present in the Domains page, since that doesn't create a .onmicrosoft.com domain. Use the steps in the link above to correctly create one.\r\n     - Don't make this domain your fallback domain.    \r\n3. Go back to the Domains page and check that the newly added .onmicrosoft.com domain appears in a 'Healthy' state.",

SharePoint has both a classic and a modern search experience. Microsoft Search in SharePoint is the modern experience. The most visible difference is that the Microsoft Search box is placed at the top of SharePoint, in the header bar. Another difference is that Microsoft Search is personal and contextual. The results you see are different from what other people see, even when you search for the same words. You'll also see different results based on where you are when you search. For example, searching at the root of your tenant looks across all of SharePoint. Searching from a hub finds content in all sites associated to the hub. Searching from an individual site finds content on that site. Searching from a list or library finds content in the list or library.

This procedure ensures that DNS name resolution is working correctly (that the virtual machine is correctly configured with DNS servers in the virtual network) and that packets can be sent to and from the cross-premises virtual network.   \r\nRun the following PowerShell command block twice, once for each SQL server, to configure them to use the extra drives for new databases and for accounts and permissions:  \r\n```\r\n$domain = \"<your Windows Server AD domain name, such as CORP for corp.contoso.com>\"\r\n$spFarmDBAcctName=$domain +\"\\sp_farm_db\"\r\n$spFarmInstallAcctName=$domain +\"\\sp_install\"\n\n--- [Chunk 5 | Source: allow-syncing-only-on-specific-domains.md] ---\nTo ensure users sync OneDrive files only on managed computers, you can configure OneDrive to sync only on PCs that are joined to specific domains.",

We're working on a fix for this issue.\r\n- Certain AD FS configurations may require additional setup to work with this release. Run the following command on your AD FS server to ensure FormsAuthentication is added to the list of PrimaryIntranetAuthenticationProvider:\r\n     `Set-AdfsGlobalAuthenticationPolicy -PrimaryIntranetAuthenticationProvider @('WindowsAuthentication', 'FormsAuthentication')`\r\n- If you enable location-based conditional access, users get a prompt about every 90 to 120 minutes by default when they leave the set of approved IP address ranges. The exact timing depends on the access token expiry duration (60 minutes by default), when their computer last obtained a new access token, and any specific conditional access timeouts put in place.\n\n--- [Chunk 2 | Source: authentication-context-example.md] ---\nSome apps don't work with authentication contexts. We recommend testing apps on a site with authentication context enabled before broadly deploying this feature.\r\nThe following apps and scenarios don't work with authentication contexts:\r\n- Older version of Office apps (see the [list of supported versions](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-teams-groups-sites#more-information-about-the-dependencies-for-the-authentication-context-option))\r\n- SharePoint mobile apps (iOS and Android)\r\n- Viva Engage\r\n- OneNote app can't be added to channel if the associated SharePoint site has an authentication context.\r\n- Teams channel meeting recording upload fails on sites with an authentication context.\r\n- SharePoint folder renaming in Teams fails if the site has an authentication context.\r\n- Teams webinar scheduling fails if OneDrive has an authentication context.\r\n- The OneDrive sync app won't sync sites with an authentication context.\r\n- Associating an authentication context to the enterprise application catalog site collection isn't supported.\r\n- The \u201cVisualize SharePoint List in Power BI\u201d feature doesn't currently support authentication context.\r\n- Outlook on Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS don't support communication with SharePoint sites protected by an Authentication Context.\r\n- The multiple-file download feature currently doesn't function when both the authentication context and 'Use Conditional Access App Control' in session control are enabled in the conditional access policy.\r\n- The file copy and move feature between different regions (cross-geo) currently doesn\u2019t function when an authentication context is applied to the destination site.\r\n- Exporting to Excel as an Excel Web Query (IQY) doesn't currently support authentication context.\n\n--- [Chunk 3 | Source: control-access-from-unmanaged-devices.md] ---\nThe following parameters can be used with  `-ConditionalAccessPolicy AllowLimitedAccess` for both the organization-wide setting and the site-level setting:\r\n `-AllowEditing $false` Prevents users from editing Office files in the browser.\r\n `-ReadOnlyForUnmanagedDevices $true` Makes the entire site read-only for impacted users.\r\n `-LimitedAccessFileType OfficeOnlineFilesOnly` Allows users to preview only Office files in the browser. This option increases security but may be a barrier to user productivity.\r\n `-LimitedAccessFileType WebPreviewableFiles` (default) Allows users to preview Office files in the browser. This option optimizes for user productivity but offers less security for files that aren't Office files. **Warning:** This option is known to cause problems with PDF and image file types because they can be required to be downloaded to the end user's machine to render in the browser. Plan the use of this control carefully. Otherwise, your users could be faced with unexpected \"Access Denied\" errors.\r\n `-LimitedAccessFileType OtherFiles` Allows users to download files that can't be previewed, such as .zip and .exe. This option offers less security. If this mode is enabled, then for downloading files like .zip or .exe, you can copy the url of the file and paste in browser (example: `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/test/Shared%20Documents/test1.zip`).\r\nThe `AllowDownlownloadingNonWebViewableFiles` parameter is no longer supported. Use `LimitedAccessFileType` instead.\r\nPeople outside the organization will be affected when you use conditional access policies to block or limit access from unmanaged devices. If users have shared items with specific people (who must enter a verification code sent to their email address), you can exempt them from this policy by running the following command.\r\n```powershell\r\nSet-SPOTenant -ApplyAppEnforcedRestrictionsToAdHocRecipients $false\r\n```\r\n> [!NOTE]\n\n--- [Chunk 4 | Source: b2b-sync.md] ---\nThe tenant admin can enable several kinds of conditional access policies at their tenant. When a guest is going to access a tenant's content, those policies may need to be adjusted for the guests so they can gain access.\r\n- Currently the sync client doesn't support interactive authentication UI when syncing external content. Any policy that would require a sign-in UI such as MFA (multifactor authentication) or TOU (terms of use) prompt, will prevent the syncing of the external content from that tenant. If a tenant admin deploys such a policy before a guest starts syncing from that tenant, the user is unable to establish the sync relationship. If the policy is deployed after a guest is syncing content from the tenant, that guest will receive an error and be unable to continue to sync from the tenant.\r\n- Tenants may update their Terms of Use (TOU) from time to time. A policy can trigger the user to view and accept the updated TOU via an interactive authentication prompt. Since sync doesn't support external tenant sign-in UI, sync indicates it's unable to sync the external site's content.\r\n- Device Compliance requires user machines to be managed by the tenant and then to be up to date with requirements. For guests, their machines are likely to be managed by their own organization and thus are incompatible with requiring their machines to be managed by the content sharing tenant.\r\n- Location-based conditional access policies are typically used to enforce more requirements like MFA when the user isn't connecting from a trusted location (such as the tenant's office network). Typically in a guest scenario the client machine won't be located at the trusted locations, and since sync doesn't support MFA, you likely don't want this policy to apply to your guests.\r\nFor more information, see [Authentication and Conditional Access for External Identities](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/authentication-conditional-access).\n\n--- [Chunk 5 | Source: redirect-known-folders.md] ---\nWe recommend that you upgrade to the latest available build before you deploy.\r\nFor information on issues that can prevent folders from being moved, see [Fix problems with folder protection](https://support.office.com/article/d61a7930-a6fb-4b95-b28a-6552e77c3057#BKMK_FixProblems). Known Folder Move doesn't work for users syncing OneDrive files in SharePoint Server.\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> If your organization is large and your users have many files in their known folders, make sure you roll out the configuration slowly to minimize the network impact of uploading files. For users who have many files in their known folders, consider using the policy [Limit the sync app upload rate to a percentage of throughput](use-group-policy.md#limit-the-sync-app-upload-rate-to-a-percentage-of-throughput) temporarily to minimize the network impact and then disable the policy once uploads are complete.",

Unlike other cloud storage providers, most of the advanced enterprise-focused features in OneDrive are available for every subscription type, enabling organizations to use OneDrive in whatever way benefits them the most. This guide describes the features available and how they can benefit your organization.\n\n--- [Chunk 2 | Source: my-sites-overview.md] ---\nThe **OneDrive** tab or tile links to the user's OneDrive. OneDrive is the user's personal file storage and synchronization service for business use.   \r\nThe user's OneDrive usually includes a private folder and a folder that is shared with everyone, or with specific people. For more information, see [Overview of OneDrive in SharePoint Server](../sites/onedrive-for-business-overview.md).\n\n--- [Chunk 3 | Source: onedrive-for-business-overview.md] ---\n[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)]   \r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> While OneDrive is used in both SharePoint Server on-premises and Microsoft 365 environments, this article describes how it works in SharePoint Server. For more information about how it works in a Microsoft 365 environment, see [What is OneDrive?](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=747076).   \r\nMicrosoft OneDrive is the default document library in a user's in SharePoint Server or in Microsoft 365. The contents of this library can optionally be synchronized with one or more of the user's computers or devices.   \r\nBy using OneDrive, you can help ensure that business files for your users are stored in a central location. Storing business files in one location makes it easy for users to share and collaborate on documents. If you're using OneDrive, you can also reduce your on-premises storage costs by moving your users' files to the cloud.  \r\nOneDrive is different from the consumer OneDrive service in that OneDrive is based on SharePoint and is meant for storing a user's business documents and files. Consumer OneDrive is a separate service that is meant for personal use.\n\n--- [Chunk 4 | Source: onedrive-overview.md] ---\nUsers can upload, download, and interact with OneDrive files from a web browser, but the ideal OneDrive experience comes from the Windows and Mac sync apps and the iOS and Android mobile apps. With these clients and apps, saving files to OneDrive and interacting with them is easier than visiting a website each time you need something. Through this experience, you can seamlessly integrate OneDrive into your existing file interaction experiences.\r\nFor information about planning and deploying the sync app for your organization, see [Plan file sync for SharePoint and OneDrive in Microsoft 365](plan-file-sync.md).\n\n--- [Chunk 5 | Source: onedrive-for-business-overview.md] ---\nIn SharePoint Server, OneDrive is simply the document library in a user's MySite. This provides personal storage for your users, either directly through the document library in their My Site, or as a save location in Office 2013 or Office 2016. While OneDrive files are saved to the cloud, in OneDrive in a SharePoint Server on-premises environment, user files are stored in the SharePoint Content database in the SQL Server that you are using for SharePoint Server. User storage quotas are set through site settings for the web application that is hosting the My Site host site.  \r\n![OneDrive in SharePoint Server 2013 on-premises](../media/17d99a5e-4b0b-42a6-ac17-0118efdf56df.jpg)",

Site ownership policies allow you to customize how ownership is determined by allowing you to:\r\n- Choose who is considered responsible for managing a site in your organization - site owners or site admins or both.  \r\n- Define the minimum number of owners or admins a site should have, currently up to 2.\r\nThe policy identifies all sites that aren't compliant with the configured ownership criteria and generate the report. If your policy is active, email notifications would then be sent for identified sites.  \r\nWe recommend choosing 2 as the minimum owner count so that sites with a single owner are identified and another owner is added immediately.

Send your users links to [Share OneDrive files and folders](https://support.office.com/article/9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07) and [Share SharePoint files or folders](https://support.office.com/article/1fe37332-0f9a-4719-970e-d2578da4941c), and include information about your organization's policies for sharing information.\n\n--- [Chunk 5 | Source: restricted-sharepoint-search.md] ---\nRestricted SharePoint Search gives you time to review and audit site permissions. We provide Restricted SharePoint Search to help you maintain momentum with your Copilot deployment while you're implementing comprehensive data security with [SharePoint Advanced Management](/sharepoint/advanced-management), and [Microsoft Purview](/purview/ai-microsoft-purview). Combined, these solutions offer a complete solution for data discovery, protection, and governance, ensuring a secure and managed data lifecycle.\r\nRestricted SharePoint Search addresses oversharing concerns by allowing organizations to:\r\n- Prevent sites from showing up in organization-wide search results and Copilot experiences until your admins or site owners can check the permissions on the site content;\r\n- Honor existing site permissions, and let site owners manage individual site permissions.\r\nIf Restricted SharePoint Search is enabled, the customer's experience is impacted in the following ways:\r\n- Search results are limited to sites on the allowed list, users\u2019 frequently visited sites, sites that users already have permissions to, and users\u2019 recently accessed files.  Turning on this feature impacts the overall search experience, even for non-Copilot users.\r\n- Copilot has less information available to reference, which may impact its ability to provide accurate and comprehensive responses.\r\nRemember, whether you have enabled Restricted SharePoint Search, users in your organization are always able to interact with files and content they own or that they have previously accessed in Copilot    .",

Go to [Settings in the SharePoint admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185072){:target=\"_blank\"}, and sign in with an account that has [admin permissions](/sharepoint/sharepoint-admin-role) for your organization.\r\n   > [!NOTE]\r\n   > If you have Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China), [sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850627), then browse to the SharePoint admin center and open the Sharing page.\r\n2. Select **Sync**.\r\n    ![Sync settings in the SharePoint admin center](media/sp-sync-settings.png)  \r\n3. Select the **Allow syncing only on computers joined to specific domains** check box.\r\n4. Add the [GUID of each domain](/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-addomain) for the member computers that you want to be able to sync.\r\n   > [!NOTE]\r\n   > Make sure to add the domain GUID of the computer domain membership. If users are in a separate domain, the only requirement is adding the domain GUID the computer account is joined to.\r\n   > [!IMPORTANT]\r\n   > This setting is only applicable to Active Directory domains. It doesn't apply to Microsoft Entra domains. If you have devices that are only Microsoft Entra joined, consider using a [Conditional Access Policy](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview) instead. For details, see [Enable conditional access support in the OneDrive sync app](enable-conditional-access.md).\r\n5.

For more information, see [Allow syncing only on computers joined to specific domains](/onedrive/allow-syncing-only-on-specific-domains).\n\n--- [Chunk 4 | Source: control-access-from-unmanaged-devices.md] ---\nWith at least the permissions of a [SharePoint Administrator](./sharepoint-admin-role.md) in Microsoft 365, you can block or limit access to SharePoint and OneDrive content from unmanaged devices (those not [hybrid AD joined](/azure/active-directory/devices/overview#hybrid-azure-ad-joined-devices) or compliant in Intune). You can block or limit access for:\r\n- All users in the organization or only some users or security groups.\r\n- All sites in the organization or only some sites.\r\nBlocking access helps provide security but comes at the cost of usability and productivity. When access is blocked, users see the following error.\r\n![The experience when access is blocked](media/unmanaged-device-access-blocked.png)\r\nLimiting access allows users to remain productive while addressing the risk of accidental data loss on unmanaged devices. When you limit access, users on managed devices have full access (unless they use one of the browser and operating system combinations listed in [Supported browsers](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-conditions#supported-browsers)). Users on unmanaged devices have browser-only access with no ability to download, print, or sync files. They also won't be able to access content through apps, including the Microsoft Office desktop apps. When you limit access, you can choose to allow or block editing files in the browser. When web access is limited, users see the following message at the top of sites.\r\n![The experience when web access is limited](media/unmanaged-device-limited-web-access.png)\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> - Blocking or limiting access on unmanaged devices relies on Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies.

Individual sites can be locked down further, but cannot be made more permissive than, the organizational settings.\r\nA key decision for your SharePoint and OneDrive rollout is who content can be shared with:\r\n- **Anyone** - Users can share files and folders using links that don't require sign-in.\r\n- **New and existing guests** - Guests are added to the directory when an item is shared and must sign in or provide a verification code to access the content.\r\n- **Existing guests** - Users can only share with guests already in your organization's directory. (This setting is not recommended because guests can be added to the directory in various ways outside of SharePoint and OneDrive.)\r\n- **Only people in your organization** - No external sharing is allowed.\r\nThese settings can be set separately for SharePoint and OneDrive, though the OneDrive setting cannot be more permissive than the SharePoint setting.\r\nImportant decisions:\r\n- Do you want to allow external sharing? If not, choose the **Only people in your organization** option.\r\n- Do you want to allow users to create sharing links that allow unauthenticated (anonymous) people to access files or folders? If so, choose **Anyone**.\n\n--- [Chunk 3 | Source: deploy-file-collaboration.md] ---\nin Microsoft 365](shareable-links-anyone-specific-people-organization.md).\r\n**Unauthenticated access with *Anyone* links**\r\n*Anyone* links are a great way to easily share files and folders with people outside your organization. However, if you're sharing sensitive information, this may not be the best option.\r\nIf you require people outside your organization to authenticate, *Anyone* links won't be available to users and you're able to audit guest activity on shared files and folders.\r\nThough *Anyone* links don't require people outside your organization to authenticate, you can track the usage of *Anyone* links and revoke access if needed.\r\nIf you want to allow *Anyone* links, there are several options for a more secure sharing experience.\r\nYou can restrict *Anyone* links to read-only. You can also set an expiration time limit, after which the link stops working.\r\nAnother option is to configure a different link type to be displayed to the user by default. This can help minimize the chances of inappropriate sharing. For example, if you want to allow *Anyone* links but are concerned that they only be used for specific purposes, you can [set the default link type](change-default-sharing-link.md) to *Specific people* links or *People in your organization* links instead of *Anyone* links. Users would then have to explicitly select *Anyone* links when they share a file or folder.\r\nYou can also use data loss prevention to restrict *Anyone* link access to files that contain sensitive information.\r\n***People in your organization* links**\r\n*People in your organization* links are a great way to share information within your organization. *People in your organization* links work for anyone in your organization, so users can share files and folders with people who aren't part of a team or members of a site. The link when redeemed, gives access to the particular file or folder and can be passed around inside the organization.\n\n--- [Chunk 4 | Source: external-sharing-overview.md] ---\nSharePoint has external sharing settings at both the organization level and the site level (previously called the \"site collection\" level). To allow external sharing on any site, you must allow it at the organization level. You can then restrict external sharing for other sites. If a site's external sharing option and the organization-level sharing option don't match, the most restrictive value will always be applied. OneDrive sharing settings can be the same as or more restrictive than the SharePoint settings.  \r\nWhichever option you choose at the organization or site level, the more restrictive functionality is still available. For example, if you choose to allow unauthenticated sharing using \"Anyone\" links, users can still share with guests, who sign in, and with internal users. \r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> Even if your organization-level setting allows external sharing, not all new sites allow it by default. See [Default site sharing settings](/microsoft-365/solutions/microsoft-365-guest-settings#default-site-sharing-settings) for more information.\r\n**Security and privacy**  \r\nIf you have confidential information that should never be shared externally, we recommend storing the information in a site that has external sharing turned off. Create additional sites as needed to use for external sharing. This helps you to manage security risk by preventing external access to sensitive information.\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> To limit *internal* sharing of contents on a site, you can prevent site members from sharing, and enable access requests.

You can choose which link type is shown by default:\r\n- *Specific people* links require the user to specify a list of people who will have access to the file or folder.\r\n- *Only people in your organization* links provide access to the file or folder to anyone in your organization who has the link.\r\n- *Anyone* links (if you've enabled them in your organization level sharing settings) provide anonymous access to anyone who has the link, including people outside your organization.\r\nYou can also choose the default permission level - view or edit - for sharing links.\r\nThese options can also be configured for individual sites. See [Change the sharing settings for a site](/sharepoint/change-external-sharing-site) for details.\r\nIf you've enabled *Anyone* links, you can choose if these links should expire after a given period and if they should allow edit access or just view access.",

Even better: as part of your custom site provisioning process, configure RAC policy on new sites from the get-go and proactively avoid oversharing forever.\r\n- Use [Restricted Content Discovery](/sharepoint/restricted-content-discovery) to leave permissions in place, but prevent the content from being available to Microsoft 365 Copilot and Organization-wide search experiences.\r\n- Consider blocking downloads from selected sites via a block download policy. Or specifically [block the download of Teams meeting recordings and transcripts](/microsoftteams/block-download-meeting-recording).\r\n- Finally, consider applying encryption action with \"extract rights\" enforced on business-critical office documents.

IT admins can manage them like any other guest account in their directory.\r\nGuest accounts are used for sharing sites, and you can always add guests to your directory if you need to give them access to more than just a file or folder.\r\nThe following table shows the differences between sharing with people who have guest accounts and with ad hoc external recipients.\r\n|&nbsp;|Guest account|Ad hoc external recipient|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|Can access shared files and folders|Yes|Yes|\r\n|Verify access by...|Signing in to Microsoft 365|Entering a time-sensitive and single-use code sent to the email address that the file or folder was share with|\r\n|Actions are audited|Yes|Yes|\r\n|Can have friendly name|Yes|Friendly name is the email address that the file or folder was shared with|\r\n|Can be Group members|Yes|No|\r\n|Can edit in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or other Microsoft 365 apps|Yes|No|\r\n|Access controlled by Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies|Yes|No|\r\n When you use the Share dialog box to share with \"specific people\" and the recipients are all outside the organization, then a secure link is created and the specified email addresses are secured, or added, to the link. This appears in audit logs in the following ways.\r\n> [!NOTE]\n\n--- [Chunk 4 | Source: sharepoint-azureb2b-integration.md] ---\n> [!Important]\r\n> After enabling Microsoft Entra B2B integration, external users attempting to access previously shared links (One Time Passcode) will encounter access issues. They receive error 'This organization has updated its guest access settings'. To restore access, your users need to reshare files/folders/sites to external users.\r\nThis article describes how to enable Microsoft SharePoint and Microsoft OneDrive integration with [Microsoft Entra B2B](/entra/external-id/what-is-b2b).\r\nMicrosoft Entra B2B provides authentication and management of guests. Authentication happens via one-time passcode when they don't already have a work or school account or a Microsoft account.\r\nWith SharePoint and OneDrive integrated with Azure B2B Invitation Manager, you can share files, folders, list items, document libraries, and sites with external people. This feature provides an upgraded experience from the existing secure external sharing recipient experience. Additionally, Azure B2B Invitation Manager offers a one-time passcode feature. This feature allows users without Work, School, or Microsoft accounts to authenticate using a code, instead of creating a new account.\r\nEnabling this integration doesn't change your sharing settings. For example, if you have site collections where external sharing is turned off, it remains off.\r\nSharePoint and OneDrive integration with the Microsoft Entra B2B one-time passcode feature is enabled by default for new tenants.\r\nAdvantages of Microsoft Entra B2B include:\r\n- Invited people outside your organization are each given an account in the directory and are subject to Microsoft Entra ID access policies such as multifactor authentication.\r\n- Invitations to a SharePoint site use Microsoft Entra B2B and no longer require users to have or create a Microsoft account.\r\n- If you have Google federation in Microsoft Entra ID, federated users can now access SharePoint and OneDrive resources that you shared with them.\n\n--- [Chunk 5 | Source: collaboration-options.md] ---\nExternal sharing in SharePoint and OneDrive uses [Microsoft Entra B2B collaboration](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/what-is-b2b) to create guest accounts for people outside the organization. Guests can be given access to SharePoint sites or to individual files and folders in SharePoint and OneDrive.\r\nExternal sharing is enabled by default in Microsoft 365, including SharePoint and OneDrive. We recommend leaving external sharing enabled. Microsoft 365 external sharing options can provide a more secure and governable sharing environment than sending attachments through email or using consumer sharing services.\r\nUse the <a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185222\" target=\"_blank\">Sharing page in the SharePoint admin center</a> to configure your sharing options.

To allow external sharing on any site, you must allow it at the organization level. You can then restrict external sharing for other sites. If a site's external sharing option and the organization-level sharing option don't match, the most restrictive value will always be applied. OneDrive sharing settings can be the same as or more restrictive than the SharePoint settings.  \r\nWhichever option you choose at the organization or site level, the more restrictive functionality is still available. For example, if you choose to allow unauthenticated sharing using \"Anyone\" links, users can still share with guests, who sign in, and with internal users. \r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> Even if your organization-level setting allows external sharing, not all new sites allow it by default.

Create additional sites as needed to use for external sharing. This helps you to manage security risk by preventing external access to sensitive information.\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> To limit *internal* sharing of contents on a site, you can prevent site members from sharing, and enable access requests.

If you enable external sharing for a site and it's later turned off for your organization, external sharing becomes unavailable at the site level and any shared links stop working. If it's turned back on for the organization, the site sharing setting returns to what it was before and the shared links resume working.\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> You might have site content shared with a Microsoft 365 group that has guest members, and the group settings prevent guest members from accessing group resources. In this case, even if you turn on external sharing for the site, guests of the group may not be able to access site content.

Depending on your business needs and the sensitivity of your data, you can:\r\n- Disallow sharing with people outside your organization.\r\n- Require people outside your organization to authenticate.\r\n- Restrict sharing to specified domains.\r\nYou can configure these settings for the entire organization, or for each site independently (except private or shared channel sites). For detailed information, see [Turn sharing on or off](turn-external-sharing-on-or-off.md) and [Turn sharing on or off for a site](change-external-sharing-site.md).\r\nSee [Limit accidental exposure to files when sharing with guests](/microsoft-365/solutions/share-limit-accidental-exposure) for more guidance around sharing with people outside your organization.\r\nWhen users share files and folders, a shareable link is created which has permissions to the item. There are three primary link types:\r\n- *Anyone* - links that work for anyone and don't require sign-in\r\n- *People in your organization* - links that work for users in your organization\r\n- *Specific people* - links that work for the people specified when the link is created\r\nFor more information about these link types, see [How shareable links work in OneDrive and SharePoint in Microsoft 365](shareable-links-anyone-specific-people-organization.md).\r\n**Unauthenticated access with *Anyone* links**\r\n*Anyone* links are a great way to easily share files and folders with people outside your organization. However, if you're sharing sensitive information, this may not be the best option.\r\nIf you require people outside your organization to authenticate, *Anyone* links won't be available to users and you're able to audit guest activity on shared files and folders.\n\n--- [Chunk 5 | Source: get-ready-copilot-sharepoint-advanced-management.md] ---\nTo minimize accidental content oversharing via Copilot results, it's crucial to implement the best practice sharing settings. Proactive safeguards are key. To effectively prepare your organization for Copilot, set the appropriate sharing settings for end users at both the organization and site levels:  \r\n**At the organization level**:\r\n- Update [sharing link defaults for your organization ](/sharepoint/turn-external-sharing-on-or-off#file-and-folder-links) for your organization from organization-wide sharing to specific people links.\r\n- To reduce risks around accidental misuse, consider hiding broad-scope permissions from your end users. [This example](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant) hides \"Everyone Except External Users\" in the People Picker control so that no end user can use it.\r\n**At the site level**:\r\nConsider educating site admins on the site-level controls they can use to [restrict members from sharing](/powershell/module/microsoft.online.sharepoint.powershell/set-spotenant).

We recommend changing addresses during times when site usage is low.\r\nYou can change the address of up to 100 sites at a time. To change another site address, wait for ongoing changes to finish.\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> If you need to revert a site address change, follow the steps in [Revert a site address change](#revert-a-site-address-change).\n\n--- [Chunk 2 | Source: change-your-sharepoint-domain-name.md] ---\n> - The domain name change affects only SharePoint and OneDrive URLs. It doesn't impact email addresses.\r\n> - For info about changing a site address, for example, from `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/sample1` to  `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/sample2`, see [Change a site address](change-site-address.md). \r\n> - The domain rename feature isn't available for organizations that have set up multi-geo. This includes those that had enabled a trial or the paid offering in the past. \r\n> - If your organization uses special clouds or government clouds (GCC, GCC High, DoD, etc.), or still has a .de domain, your domain name can't be changed.\r\n> - When you rename your SharePoint domain, we create a redirect at the previous address, which will expire 1 year after the rename.\r\n> - You can only rename your SharePoint domain once. If you need more renames, submit a support request by selecting [Rename a SharePoint Tenant more than once](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/?searchSolutions=Rename%20a%20SharePoint%20Tenant%20more%20than%20once).\r\n> - Changing your SharePoint domain name back to the original name after you rename it isn't supported. For example, if you change your SharePoint domain from `contoso.sharepoint.com` to `fabrikam.sharepoint.com`, changing it back to `contoso.sharepoint.com` isn't supported.\r\n> - A redirect site is created for each site rename and each redirect takes 0.15 MB. So, an organization should readily have '0.15MB * no. of sites' amount of storage available on the tenant before they rename.\n\n--- [Chunk 3 | Source: change-site-address.md] ---\nIf you need to change the address of a site that was previously changed, we recommend not renaming the site again. This can cause issues if you later want to use the current address for another site. Instead, we recommend returning the site back to its original address. To do so, you use an additional site rename and delete certain redirect sites. [Learn how to delete redirect sites](manage-site-redirects.md).\r\nFor a case where you changed https://<i></i>contoso.sharepoint.<i></i>com/sites/*project-x* to https://<i></i>contoso.sharepoint.<i></i>com/sites/*project-y* and want to revert back, the steps to follow are:\r\n1. Delete the redirect from *project-x* to *project-y* by using the [Remove-SPOSite cmdlet](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/remove-sposite) on the *project-x* address.\r\n2. Initiate a new site address change from *project-y* to *project-x*.\r\n3. Delete the redirect from *project-y* to *project-x* by using the [Remove-SPOSite cmdlet](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/remove-sposite) on the *project-y* address.\r\n   After following these steps, you should be back to the original state before the site address change.\n\n--- [Chunk 4 | Source: manage-site-redirects.md] ---\nWhen you [change a SharePoint site address](change-site-address.md), such as [moving a site to a different geo location](/office365/enterprise/move-sharepoint-between-geo-locations), or [swapping a site](modern-root-site.md#replace-your-root-site), we automatically create redirects to ensure that prior URLs continue to work. These redirects are sites that use a special site template at the prior site URL.\r\nFor example, if you changed a site address from https://<i></i>contoso.sharepoint.<i></i>com/sites/*OldSiteName* to https://<i></i>contoso.sharepoint.<i></i>com/sites/*NewSiteName*, or if you moved a site from https://<i></i>*contoso*.sharepoint.<i></i>com/sites/SiteName to https://<i></i>*contosoEUR*.sharepoint.<i></i>com/sites/SiteName, we place a redirect (Template type REDIRECTSITE#0) at the old URL. This redirect contains special headers and logic to redirect your browser requests to the new site.\r\nIn some cases, you might want to free up the old URL to use it for a new site. To free up the old URL, you need to delete the redirect.\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> After you delete a redirect, any request to that URL won't get redirected. This means that any bookmarks, links, or Shared With Me references aren't routed to the new URL.\n\n--- [Chunk 5 | Source: recent-actions-panel.md] ---\nThe recent actions panel lets you review and monitor the last 30 changes you've made to a SharePoint site's properties (such as renaming a site, deleting a site, changing storage quota) within the last 30 days in the [SharePoint admin center](/sharepoint/get-started-new-admin-center).

They should select a link type based on the people to whom they want to give permission. The following link types are available: \r\n- Anyone with the link (previously called \"anonymous access\" or \"shareable\")\r\n- People in your organization with the link \r\n- People with existing access\r\n- Specific people \r\n  ![Screenshot of Link settings.](media/link-settings.png)\r\nAs a [SharePoint Administrator](./sharepoint-admin-role.md) or above, you may want to enable users to send \"Anyone\" links, but you may not want this to be the default type of link when users select to share files and folders. You can set the default type of link to something more restrictive, while still allowing users to select other types of links as needed. You can change this setting at the organization level and at the site (previously called \"site collection\") level.   \r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> The default sharing link setting applies only to libraries that use the new experience.<br>This setting does not affect Outlook Web App, Outlook 2016, or Office clients prior to Office 2016. \r\nFor info about the changing this setting at the organization level, see [File and folder links](turn-external-sharing-on-or-off.md#file-and-folder-links).\n\n--- [Chunk 3 | Source: deploy-file-collaboration.md] ---\nin Microsoft 365](shareable-links-anyone-specific-people-organization.md).\r\n**Unauthenticated access with *Anyone* links**\r\n*Anyone* links are a great way to easily share files and folders with people outside your organization. However, if you're sharing sensitive information, this may not be the best option.\r\nIf you require people outside your organization to authenticate, *Anyone* links won't be available to users and you're able to audit guest activity on shared files and folders.\r\nThough *Anyone* links don't require people outside your organization to authenticate, you can track the usage of *Anyone* links and revoke access if needed.\r\nIf you want to allow *Anyone* links, there are several options for a more secure sharing experience.\r\nYou can restrict *Anyone* links to read-only. You can also set an expiration time limit, after which the link stops working.\r\nAnother option is to configure a different link type to be displayed to the user by default. This can help minimize the chances of inappropriate sharing. For example, if you want to allow *Anyone* links but are concerned that they only be used for specific purposes, you can [set the default link type](change-default-sharing-link.md) to *Specific people* links or *People in your organization* links instead of *Anyone* links. Users would then have to explicitly select *Anyone* links when they share a file or folder.\r\nYou can also use data loss prevention to restrict *Anyone* link access to files that contain sensitive information.\r\n***People in your organization* links**\r\n*People in your organization* links are a great way to share information within your organization. *People in your organization* links work for anyone in your organization, so users can share files and folders with people who aren't part of a team or members of a site. The link when redeemed, gives access to the particular file or folder and can be passed around inside the organization.\n\n--- [Chunk 4 | Source: collaboration-options.md] ---\nThe organization level sharing settings for SharePoint and OneDrive provide a default setting for sites and OneDrive libraries. Individual sites can be locked down further, but cannot be made more permissive than, the organizational settings.\r\nA key decision for your SharePoint and OneDrive rollout is who content can be shared with:\r\n- **Anyone** - Users can share files and folders using links that don't require sign-in.\r\n- **New and existing guests** - Guests are added to the directory when an item is shared and must sign in or provide a verification code to access the content.\r\n- **Existing guests** - Users can only share with guests already in your organization's directory. (This setting is not recommended because guests can be added to the directory in various ways outside of SharePoint and OneDrive.)\r\n- **Only people in your organization** - No external sharing is allowed.\r\nThese settings can be set separately for SharePoint and OneDrive, though the OneDrive setting cannot be more permissive than the SharePoint setting.\r\nImportant decisions:\r\n- Do you want to allow external sharing? If not, choose the **Only people in your organization** option.\r\n- Do you want to allow users to create sharing links that allow unauthenticated (anonymous) people to access files or folders? If so, choose **Anyone**.\n\n--- [Chunk 5 | Source: modern-experience-sharing-permissions.md] ---\nThe external sharing features of SharePoint let users in your organization share content with people outside the organization (such as partners, vendors, clients, or customers). Planning for external sharing should be included as part of your overall permissions planning for SharePoint.\r\nSharePoint has external sharing settings at both the organization level and the site level (previously called the \"site collection\" level). To allow external sharing on any site, you must allow it at the organization level. You can then restrict external sharing for other sites. \r\n![External sharing settings in the SharePoint admin center](media/externalsharing.png)  \r\nWhichever option you choose at the organization or site level, the more restrictive functionality is still available. For example, if you choose to allow sharing using *Anyone* links, users can still share with guests, who sign in, and with internal users.   \r\nExternal sharing is turned on by default for your organization. Default settings for individual sites vary depending on the type of site. See [Site level settings](/microsoft-365/solutions/microsoft-365-guest-settings#default-site-sharing-settings) for more information.\r\n[Shared channels in teams](/MicrosoftTeams/shared-channels) do not use guest accounts for sharing with people outside the organization. However, external sharing must be enabled for people outside the organization to be invited to shared channels.\r\nTo set up guest sharing for a site, see [Collaborate with guests in a site](/microsoft-365/solutions/collaborate-in-site).",

This is also known as location-based policy.  \r\nTo do this, you define a trusted network boundary by specifying one or more authorized IP address ranges. Any user who attempts to access SharePoint and OneDrive from outside this network boundary (using web browser, desktop app, or mobile app on any device) will be blocked.  \r\n![Access restricted message in browser](media/7efa9e14-cd9e-4369-8f24-c218c222025d.png)  \r\nHere are some important considerations for setting a location-based policy:  \r\n- **External sharing**: If files and folders have been shared with guests who authenticate, they will not be able to access the resources outside of the defined IP address range.     \r\n- **Access from first and third-party apps**: Normally, a SharePoint document can be accessed from apps like Exchange, Viva Engage, Skype, Teams, Planner, Power Automate, PowerBI, Power Apps, OneNote, and so on. When a location-based policy is enabled, apps that do not support location-based policies are blocked. The only apps that currently support location-based policies are Teams, Viva Engage, and Exchange. This means that all other apps are blocked, even when these apps are hosted within the trusted network boundary. This is because SharePoint cannot determine whether a user of these apps is within the trusted boundary.    \r\n    > [!NOTE]\r\n    > We recommend that when a location-based policy is enabled for SharePoint, the same policy and IP address ranges should be configured for Exchange and Viva Engage.
