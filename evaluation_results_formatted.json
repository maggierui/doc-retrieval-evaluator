The benefits of using SharePoint Server publishing sites include the following:  \r\n- Brand consistency by using custom design assets, such as master pages and page layouts, edited in HTML and automatically converted into SharePoint resources.    \r\n- Tight control over site navigation.    \r\n- Decentralized content creation, which enables globally contributed content.    \r\n- Centralized publishing workflow and approval processes.    \r\n- Dynamic, customized sites.\n\n--- [Chunk 2 | Source: sharepoint-server-in-microsoft-azure.md] ---\n[!INCLUDE[appliesto-xxx-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-xxx-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)]    \r\nTo realize the productivity and collaboration benefits of SharePoint, Microsoft recommends SharePoint in Microsoft 365. If SharePoint in Microsoft 365 is not the best option for you right now, you can deploy SharePoint Server 2016 on intranet servers, which can be in your on-premises datacenter or hosted in Microsoft Azure infrastructure services. Whether it's for development, testing, staging, production, or disaster recovery purposes, Azure is a perfect home for your SharePoint farms in the cloud.  \r\nHere are some of the benefits:  \r\n- You can deploy a SharePoint Server farm rapidly and scale it up or down as needed.    \r\n    You can create the infrastructure for your SharePoint servers very quickly using multiple tools and methods. Set up development or test farms or scale out your production SharePoint deployments by adding more resources. Simplify deployment and configuration with ready-to-deploy images and reduce the time to deploy complex SharePoint farms from days to hours.    \r\n- You can host your SharePoint Server farm cost-effectively.    \r\n    Pay-as-you-go pricing for server and storage capacity and per-minute billing from Azure helps you save money. When performing application or performance testing, create additional servers as needed for scale and load testing over short periods of time and remove them when you're finished. Using and paying for only the resources that you need\u2014and no more\u2014helps you reduce costs.    \r\n- You can seamlessly move virtual machines between on-premises and Azure.    \r\n    A virtual machine in Azure running Windows or SQL Server is no different than a server running in an on-premises datacenter. You can easily move virtual machines between on-premises physical servers or servers at your hosting provider and Azure to:\n\n--- [Chunk 3 | Source: it-governance-in-sharepoint.md] ---\n<a name=\"Section1\"> </a>\r\nA SharePoint service is an IT service that offers hosted sites based on SharePoint.

The following list summarizes these publishing methods.  \r\n- **Author-in-place** You use a single site collection to author content and make it available to readers of your site. Content is branded by using master pages and page layouts on the same site, and approval and publishing workflows are used to submit pages for approval and then publish them for readers. This was the primary publishing method that was available in SharePoint Server 2010.     \r\n- **Cross-site collection publishing** You use one or more site collections to author content, and one or more site collections to control the design of the site and the display of the content. The authoring site collection is used to hold the source content, and can contain catalogs of Pages libraries and lists that are indexed by the search system, and made available to the publishing site collection. The publishing site collection takes the data from the authoring site collection and shows it on web pages by using the Content Search Web Part and the Catalog-Item Reuse Web Part. These Web Parts use configured queries to get data from the search index and show it on the site. Content is branded on the publishing site by using master pages, page layouts, and display templates. These let a designer control how data appears in the Content Search Web Part and the Catalog-Item Reuse Web Part. For more information, see [Overview of cross-site publishing in SharePoint Server](overview-of-cross-site-publishing.md).\n\n--- [Chunk 2 | Source: plan-sites-and-site-collections.md] ---\n<a name=\"Section2d\"> </a>\r\nBy using a publishing site, authors can create and modify content in the form of web pages and documents, and they can use an approval process to make the content available to users who have the appropriate levels of viewing permissions. The publishing process involves creating content and then submitting it for approval. After content is approved, it is made available, or published, to the website for readers. This publishing occurs according to either a default schedule or a customized schedule, based on the needs of the project. Publishing sites can be used as intranet, extranet, or Internet sites, depending on the audience.  \r\nFor example, you might use a publishing site for an Internet site that publishes press releases. The public relations team creates press releases, uses the publishing workflow to approve new content, and specifies when it should be made available to consumers. As another example, you might use a publishing site for a corporate intranet site, where company news is made available to employees. Page authors can specify the target audience for their content, which makes the content viewable by only the members of the designated groups.  \r\nYou can use one of two ways to make published content available to users: author-in-place, or cross-site publishing. With the author-in-place method, you use a single site collection to author content and make it available to readers of your site. With the cross-site publishing method, you use one or more site collections to author content, and one or more site collections to control the design of the site and the display of the content. For more information, see [Overview of publishing to Internet, intranet, and extranet sites in SharePoint Server](../administration/overview-of-publishing-to-internet-intranet-and-extranet-sites.md).\n\n--- [Chunk 3 | Source: plan-for-internet-intranet-and-extranet-publishing-sites.md] ---\n[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)]  \r\nYou can use the publishing features in SharePoint Server to create branded Internet, intranet, and extranet sites. However, some publishing features are available only in SharePoint Server.  \r\nThere are several planning steps you have to do before you begin building publishing sites. First, decide what SharePoint Server architecture you want to have. Then determine the type of content that will be published. Next, decide whether you need multilingual support for your sites. Finally, decide which publishing method is best suited for your solution.  \r\nThis article builds on the information in [Overview of publishing to Internet, intranet, and extranet sites in SharePoint Server](overview-of-publishing-to-internet-intranet-and-extranet-sites.md).",
