The benefits of using SharePoint Server publishing sites include the following:  \r\n- Brand consistency by using custom design assets, such as master pages and page layouts, edited in HTML and automatically converted into SharePoint resources.    \r\n- Tight control over site navigation.    \r\n- Decentralized content creation, which enables globally contributed content.    \r\n- Centralized publishing workflow and approval processes.    \r\n- Dynamic, customized sites.\n\n--- [Chunk 2 | Source: sharepoint-server-in-microsoft-azure.md] ---\n[!INCLUDE[appliesto-xxx-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-xxx-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)]    \r\nTo realize the productivity and collaboration benefits of SharePoint, Microsoft recommends SharePoint in Microsoft 365. If SharePoint in Microsoft 365 is not the best option for you right now, you can deploy SharePoint Server 2016 on intranet servers, which can be in your on-premises datacenter or hosted in Microsoft Azure infrastructure services. Whether it's for development, testing, staging, production, or disaster recovery purposes, Azure is a perfect home for your SharePoint farms in the cloud.  \r\nHere are some of the benefits:  \r\n- You can deploy a SharePoint Server farm rapidly and scale it up or down as needed.    \r\n    You can create the infrastructure for your SharePoint servers very quickly using multiple tools and methods. Set up development or test farms or scale out your production SharePoint deployments by adding more resources. Simplify deployment and configuration with ready-to-deploy images and reduce the time to deploy complex SharePoint farms from days to hours.    \r\n- You can host your SharePoint Server farm cost-effectively.    \r\n    Pay-as-you-go pricing for server and storage capacity and per-minute billing from Azure helps you save money. When performing application or performance testing, create additional servers as needed for scale and load testing over short periods of time and remove them when you're finished. Using and paying for only the resources that you need\u2014and no more\u2014helps you reduce costs.    \r\n- You can seamlessly move virtual machines between on-premises and Azure.    \r\n    A virtual machine in Azure running Windows or SQL Server is no different than a server running in an on-premises datacenter. You can easily move virtual machines between on-premises physical servers or servers at your hosting provider and Azure to:\n\n--- [Chunk 3 | Source: it-governance-in-sharepoint.md] ---\n<a name=\"Section1\"> </a>\r\nA SharePoint service is an IT service that offers hosted sites based on SharePoint. The benefits of a SharePoint service include backup and recovery, content storage, support for customizations, security, and service levels based on speed and availability as show in the following illustration.\n\n--- [Chunk 4 | Source: overview-of-publishing-to-internet-intranet-and-extranet-sites.md] ---\n<a name=\"benefits\"> </a>\r\nYou can use SharePoint Server publishing sites to create different types of branded sites, depending on your business needs and goals. The following list gives examples of how you can use SharePoint Server publishing sites:  \r\n- **Internet presence site** Provide information to customers, partners, investors, and potential employees. For example, you might use an Internet presence site to provide news articles or reviews that are tagged with metadata to categorize articles so that users can search or browse for information.     \r\n- **Internet business site** Promote products and services that your company offers to customers. For example, you might use an Internet business site to show a catalog of products such as TVs, stereos, MP3 players, and mobile devices.     \r\n- **Intranet sites** Deploy a site that has a tightly managed navigation structure to provide authored content to intranet readers. For example, you might use a published intranet site to provide human resources information to employees.     \r\n- **Extranet sites** Provide access to targeted content to remote employees, partners, and customers. For example, you might use an extranet site to provide access to a knowledge base that uses authored content tagged with metadata to categorize articles so that users can search or browse for specific information, such as troubleshooting articles, support issues, and service packs.     \r\nSharePoint Server publishing sites let you establish a branded, online identity for your company or organization. The benefits of using SharePoint Server publishing sites include the following:  \r\n- Brand consistency by using custom design assets, such as master pages and page layouts, edited in HTML and automatically converted into SharePoint resources.    \r\n- Tight control over site navigation.    \r\n- Decentralized content creation, which enables globally contributed content.    \r\n- Centralized publishing workflow and approval processes.\n\n--- [Chunk 5 | Source: overview-of-cross-site-publishing.md] ---\noutside the firewall.  <br/> |\r\n|Intranet site  <br/> |You can use cross-site publishing to create an internal Human Resources (HR) website that uses a tightly managed navigation structure to show authored content. Content is authored by a small group of people, and consumed by a large group of people with the Read permission level.  <br/> |\r\n|Extranet site  <br/> |You can use cross-site publishing to create a knowledge base that is available to internal and external users in an extranet site. Content authors tag pages with metadata to categorize articles so that users can search or browse for specific information, such as troubleshooting articles, support issues, and service packs.  <br/> |\r\n|Multilingual sites  <br/> |You can use cross-site publishing together with the variations and translation features to create multiple sites that show translated content for specific languages or locales. For example, you can have English, French, and German content that is shown on sites that have .com, .fr, and .de addresses. Internet, intranet, and extranet sites can all be multilingual sites.  <br/> |   \r\nIn SharePoint Server, cross-site publishing provides the following benefits:  \r\n- Provides a broad range of possible site architectures.    \r\n- Separates content authoring from branding and rendering.    \r\n- Allows content to be shared anonymously with users on the publishing site.    \r\n- Can be used across site collections, web applications, and also across farms.    \r\n- Allows for a mix of authored pages and list content.",

The following list summarizes these publishing methods.  \r\n- **Author-in-place** You use a single site collection to author content and make it available to readers of your site. Content is branded by using master pages and page layouts on the same site, and approval and publishing workflows are used to submit pages for approval and then publish them for readers. This was the primary publishing method that was available in SharePoint Server 2010.     \r\n- **Cross-site collection publishing** You use one or more site collections to author content, and one or more site collections to control the design of the site and the display of the content. The authoring site collection is used to hold the source content, and can contain catalogs of Pages libraries and lists that are indexed by the search system, and made available to the publishing site collection. The publishing site collection takes the data from the authoring site collection and shows it on web pages by using the Content Search Web Part and the Catalog-Item Reuse Web Part. These Web Parts use configured queries to get data from the search index and show it on the site. Content is branded on the publishing site by using master pages, page layouts, and display templates. These let a designer control how data appears in the Content Search Web Part and the Catalog-Item Reuse Web Part. For more information, see [Overview of cross-site publishing in SharePoint Server](overview-of-cross-site-publishing.md).\n\n--- [Chunk 2 | Source: plan-sites-and-site-collections.md] ---\n<a name=\"Section2d\"> </a>\r\nBy using a publishing site, authors can create and modify content in the form of web pages and documents, and they can use an approval process to make the content available to users who have the appropriate levels of viewing permissions. The publishing process involves creating content and then submitting it for approval. After content is approved, it is made available, or published, to the website for readers. This publishing occurs according to either a default schedule or a customized schedule, based on the needs of the project. Publishing sites can be used as intranet, extranet, or Internet sites, depending on the audience.  \r\nFor example, you might use a publishing site for an Internet site that publishes press releases. The public relations team creates press releases, uses the publishing workflow to approve new content, and specifies when it should be made available to consumers. As another example, you might use a publishing site for a corporate intranet site, where company news is made available to employees. Page authors can specify the target audience for their content, which makes the content viewable by only the members of the designated groups.  \r\nYou can use one of two ways to make published content available to users: author-in-place, or cross-site publishing. With the author-in-place method, you use a single site collection to author content and make it available to readers of your site. With the cross-site publishing method, you use one or more site collections to author content, and one or more site collections to control the design of the site and the display of the content. For more information, see [Overview of publishing to Internet, intranet, and extranet sites in SharePoint Server](../administration/overview-of-publishing-to-internet-intranet-and-extranet-sites.md).\n\n--- [Chunk 3 | Source: plan-for-internet-intranet-and-extranet-publishing-sites.md] ---\n[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)]  \r\nYou can use the publishing features in SharePoint Server to create branded Internet, intranet, and extranet sites. However, some publishing features are available only in SharePoint Server.  \r\nThere are several planning steps you have to do before you begin building publishing sites. First, decide what SharePoint Server architecture you want to have. Then determine the type of content that will be published. Next, decide whether you need multilingual support for your sites. Finally, decide which publishing method is best suited for your solution.  \r\nThis article builds on the information in [Overview of publishing to Internet, intranet, and extranet sites in SharePoint Server](overview-of-publishing-to-internet-intranet-and-extranet-sites.md).\n\n--- [Chunk 4 | Source: publishing-sites-classic-to-modern-experience.md] ---\nPublishing sites include a variety of web parts that enable authors to insert video, rich text, forms, and dynamic content onto a site page. Three web parts that have been unique to publishing sites are the *Content query* web part to show dynamic content, the *Summary links* web part, and the *Table of contents* web part to display links to important content. The following are a selection of modern web parts that help fulfill the same purposes as these web parts.\r\n**Content query**: The [Highlighted content](https://support.office.com/article/e34199b0-ff1a-47fb-8f4d-dbcaed329efd) web part serves a similar purpose as the Content Query web part. It dynamically displays content from a document library, a site, a site collection, or multiple sites. With the Highlighted content web part, many of the advanced and confusing search/query options of the Content Query web part have been replaced with streamlined query options. However, unlike its classic counterparts, custom display templates are not allowed.\r\n**Summary links, Table of contents**: There is not a 1:1 mapping of these web parts to modern web parts. However, there are several modern web parts that can fulfill the same purpose, which is to help your users navigate from a page level to important content. These are:\r\n> [Quick links](https://support.office.com/article/e1df7561-209d-4362-96d4-469f85ab2a82)\r\n>\r\n> With Quick links, you can add links to a page and set display options like a carousel format called filmstrip, list, or a smaller compact format. Each of the links in the compact format can be arranged and displayed with or without images. It is currently not possible to populate Quick links based on a SharePoint list.\r\n>\r\n> [Link](https://support.office.com/article/19c37587-118a-4813-b25a-192f3bd829d9)\r\n>\r\n> The Link web part shows one complete URL link and adds the ability to show or hide a preview pane with the link target.\r\n>\n\n--- [Chunk 5 | Source: overview-of-publishing-to-internet-intranet-and-extranet-sites.md] ---\n<a name=\"pubsites\"> </a>\r\nSharePoint Server has three site collection templates that you can use to create a publishing site based on your site needs and goals: Publishing Portal, Product Catalog, and Enterprise Wiki. The following table describes each template.  \r\n**Publishing site collection templates**\r\n|**Template**|**Description**|\r\n|:-----|:-----|\r\n|**Publishing Portal** <br/> |Use for an Internet site or a large intranet portal site. You can use distinctive branding to customize this site. Typically, this site has many more readers than contributors. By default, this site collection template enables content approval workflows for a more formal and controlled publishing process. It also lets you grant permissions to anonymous users to view only content pages. Anonymous users cannot view SharePoint Server administrative pages, such as the **Site Settings** page.  <br/> |\r\n|**Enterprise Wiki** <br/> |A site in which your organization can publish knowledge that it accumulates and wants to share across the enterprise. It provides an easy content editing experience in a single location for co-authoring content, for discussions, and for collaborating on projects.  <br/> |\r\n|**Product Catalog** <br/> |Use for managing library or list data that is shared as a catalog for cross-site collection publishing. Catalog data is published to an Internet-facing site by using Web Parts that use Search technology. The catalog can be configured to support catalog item variants and multilingual catalog item properties. The site includes administration pages for managing faceted navigation for catalog items.  <br/> |   \r\nIn addition to using one of these established site collection templates, you can also turn on publishing for any non-publishing site by activating the SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure feature at the site collection level, and the SharePoint Server Publishing feature at the site level.",
