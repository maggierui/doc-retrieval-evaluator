Manager agent?
Answer: The agent is set to automatically update to the latest version by default.
**Question:** Does adding more agents linearly increase the throughput? Is there a cap on the max number of agents?
Answer: Based on our current data, the average speed of migration scales linearly to the number of agents, unless the overall throughput hits the upper limit of your network bandwidth. Multiple agents reading from the same source file share path can also impact throughput. There’s no limit on how many agents you can install. We have many customers who perform migrations using 20+ agents. **Note:** A single agent can process up to 10 tasks at a given time.
**Question:** Where are local Migration Manager logs stored?
Answer: The logs are stored here: `C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\SPMigration`.
**Question:** Can I rename my temporary working folder?
Answer: Yes. By default the name of the folder is `%appdata%\Microsoft\SPMigration`. Through the Migration Manager UI, you can configure the physical location of the folder where logs and reports are stored on the agent's machine including renaming your working folder.
**Question:** What should I do if I don't have enough storage space?
Answer: When you are in Manager Manager, you can see the available disc space. Choose a drive that has enough storage before starting your migration.
**Question:** What happen during incremental migration if I rename, move or delete a destination file or folder?
Answer: After a file or fold is migrated to destination, user **renames or moves** the file or folder, then remigrate,
- The source file or folder is migrated to the destination.
- The renamed/moved file or folder is kept.
After a file or folder is migrated to destination, user **deletes** the file or folder, then remigrate,
- The source file or folder is migrated to the destination.
**Question:** In file share migrations, what is the content type of a migrated document?

**Question:** Is there a Tenant to Tenant (T2T) migration solution?
Answer: Yes. Cross-tenant OneDrive migration is now available outside of Migration Manager. A cross tenant migration solution for **SharePoint** is currently available. [Learn more about the cross-tenant OneDrive migration](/microsoft-365/enterprise/cross-tenant-onedrive-migration).
**Question:** Can I migrate content from SharePoint Server?
Answer: At this time, Migration Manager supports the migration of file shares and cloud sources including Google, Dropbox, and Box. It doesn't support the migration of content from SharePoint Server. See SPMT (SharePoint Migration Tool) for SharePoint Server migration.
**Question:** Can I run the SharePoint Migration Tool (SPMT) on the same computer that I have the Migration Manager agent installed?
Answer: Yes.
**Question:** Is multifactor authentication supported by Migration Manager?
Answer: Microsoft multifactor authentication is supported; however third party multifactor authentication isn't.
**Question:** Can Migration Manager migrate content to non-English SharePoint sites?
Answer: Yes, Migration Manager can migrate content to non-English sites as long as the site title doesn’t include non-EN characters.
**Question:** Is Migration Manager available for Government clouds?
Answer: Yes. Here's how you configure it: [Government cloud settings](./mm-gov-cloud.md).
**Question:** What’s the retention policy for the blog storage?
Answer: Customers and ISVs use the [SharePoint-provided blob containers/queues](/sharepoint/dev/apis/migration-api-azure-container-and-queue) when they used the Migration API. [SAS URIs](/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview) are provided to access the container and queues. The SAS URIs are valid for three days from creation for containers and 21 days for queues. After the SAS expires, the content in the blob containers and queues isn't accessible.

a migration. There are many factors that prevent migration impacting site performance:
- Migration runs as a background activity and doesn't compete with end-user traffic.
- SharePoint and OneDrive infrastructure has built-in throttling rules that project the reliability and availability of the system. To learn more about migration throughput and factors that affect migration speed, learn more at: [General migration performance guidance](./sharepoint-online-and-onedrive-migration-speed.md).
**Question:** Does Migration Manager do incremental migrations?
Answer: Yes. The jobs created in Migration Manager do perform incremental migrations.
**Question:** The date and time in Migration Manager isn't my local time. How can I change the setting to my local time zone?
Answer: Migration Manager uses the time zone setting in the SharePoint Admin center to convert to your time zone. To update the timezone of the SharePoint Admin Center, browse to `https://<your host url>-admin.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/regionalsetng.aspx` to change the setting.
**Question:** What does **% complete** mean?
Answer: The % complete indicates the progress of the overall task migration, including the number of files migrated and the preparation work required for the remaining files to be migrated. *Note:* The **%** isn't linearly proportional to the number of files remaining to be migrated.
**Question:** What is the maximum file size that can be migrated?
Answer: For file share and cloud migrations, a file size of 250 GB is supported.
**Question**: How many task rows can I run at once when migrating content from a cloud provider?
Answer: At a maximum, only 50 task rows can run simultaneously. This total includes both scanning and migrating. This limit doesn't apply to file share migration.
**Question:** In the Migration Manager tool, is there a limit to the number of path characters you can enter?
Answer: Yes.

--- [Chunk 4 | Source: mm-faqs.md] ---
**Question:** Does the file share I'm migrating need to be on a Windows computer?
Answer: No. As long as you can access the file share from the migration agent, you can migrate it.
**Question:** Can I manually assign a task to a migration agent I set up?
Answer: No. Migration Manager does it for you by automatically distributing tasks to the next available agent. However, you can target migration tasks to a group of agents.
**Question:** How many tasks can an agent perform simultaneously?
Answer: An agent can perform 5 to 10 tasks simultaneously, depending on the size of each of the tasks.
**Question:** What happens when you ""pause"" a task?
Answer: Pausing a task doesn't release the agent to another task. The agent remains unavailable to accept a new task until the task is resumed and completed, or if the task is deleted.
**Question:** How long does an agent stay connected to Migration Manager?
Answer: The connection between an agent and Migration Manager stays active as long as the computer is still running and the SharePoint admin credentials that were used to sign into the agent are still valid. If the agent does becomes disconnected, the agent holds the token to the Migration Manager for up to seven days. After which the agent needs to be reinstalled.
**Question:** How do I remove the Migration Manager agent from a computer? 
Answer: Rerun the Migration Manager agent installer and select the **Uninstall** button.
**Question:** How do I update the Migration Manager agent?
Answer: The agent is set to automatically update to the latest version by default.
**Question:** Does adding more agents linearly increase the throughput? Is there a cap on the max number of agents?
Answer: Based on our current data, the average speed of migration scales linearly to the number of agents, unless the overall throughput hits the upper limit of your network bandwidth. Multiple agents reading from the same source file share path can also impact throughput.

Sharing links activity reports are one of the two types of Data access governance activity reports available with [SharePoint Advanced Management](advanced-management.md). These reports help you identify sites where users have created the most new sharing links in the last 28 days. Combined with other Data access governance reports, this report helps you monitor sharing activities and identify potential oversharing risks in your organization.

Site permissions for users report is one of the [Data access governance snapshot reports](/sharepoint/data-access-governance-reports#what-are-snapshot-reports) available with [SharePoint Advanced Management](advanced-management.md). This report lists all sites a user can access and allows admins to determine whether they can access the entire site or specific sections, granted directly to the user or indirectly through groups. This approach helps you quickly assess your overall security posture and identify sites that need immediate attention.

Activity reports help you track potential oversharing activities that occurred in the last 28 days. These reports focus on ""recently active"" sites where users created sharing links or shared content with large groups. For all activities tracked in activity reports, you can find corresponding ""baseline"" data in the [snapshot reports](#what-are-snapshot-reports).
Currently, two types of activity reports are available to help you identify potential oversharing:
- **[Sharing links reports](#what-is-the-sharing-links-report)**: Identifies sites where users recently created the most sharing links (including ""Anyone,"" ""People in the organization,"" and ""Specific people"" links) to help you catch potential oversharing as it happens.
- **[Shared with 'Everyone except external users' reports](#what-is-the-everyone-except-external-users-eeeu-report)**: Tracks sites where content is shared with all internal users in your organization, helping you identify broad internal exposure that could lead to unintended data access.
> [!IMPORTANT]

> You must enable data collection before you can generate activity reports. Here's what you need to know:

As part of your governance strategy, we recommend combining both snapshot and activity reports to get a complete picture of your organization's data access landscape. Here's how to use them together effectively:
1. **Start with snapshot reports**: Run site permissions reports first to understand your baseline permission structure and identify sites with the broadest exposure. We recommend running these quarterly to maintain a comprehensive view of your organization's data access.
2. **Follow up with activity reports**: Use sharing links and EEEU activity reports to monitor recent oversharing activities and catch emerging risks. We recommend running these monthly to stay on top of ongoing sharing activities.
This combination ensures you have both a complete picture of your current state and visibility into ongoing sharing activities that could create new exposure risks.","[{""search_score"": 0.020054446533322334, ""reranker_score"": 3.2661638259887695, ""id"": ""845f2af64944_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9kYXRhLWFjY2Vzcy1nb3Zlcm5hbmNlLXNpdGUtcGVybWlzc2lvbnMtdXNlcnMtcmVwb3J0Lm1kOzU1_pages_0"", ""title"": ""data-access-governance-site-permissions-users-report.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.021749084815382957, ""reranker_score"": 3.191725254058838, ""id"": ""37733bfc3002_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9kYXRhLWFjY2Vzcy1nb3Zlcm5hbmNlLXNpdGUtcGVybWlzc2lvbnMtcmVwb3J0Lm1kOzY1_pages_0"", ""title"": ""data-access-governance-site-permissions-report.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.0292735043913126, ""reranker_score"": 3.0782952308654785, ""id"": ""5784451c068a_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9wb3dlcnNoZWxsLWZvci1kYXRhLWFjY2Vzcy1nb3Zlcm5hbmNlLm1kOzU1_pages_0"", ""title"": ""powershell-for-data-access-governance.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.025073517113924026, ""reranker_score"": 3.0768773555755615, ""id"": ""5784451c068a_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9wb3dlcnNoZWxsLWZvci1kYXRhLWFjY2Vzcy1nb3Zlcm5hbmNlLm1kOzY1_pages_1"", ""title"": ""powershell-for-data-access-governance.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.02853124588727951, ""reranker_score"": 2.960611343383789, ""id"": ""ea6ba612037f_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9kYXRhLWFjY2Vzcy1nb3Zlcm5hbmNlLXJlcG9ydHMubWQ7Nw2_pages_0"", ""title"": ""data-access-governance-reports.md""}]"

Run the 'site permissions for the organization' report to learn where content overexposure risk exists in all sites on your organization, regardless of site activities. This report scans all sites in your organization, and lists all sites with the corresponding number of users who has permissions to any content within the site. You can get the baseline of your organization's permissions state, such as total permissioned users, content shared with all users, content shared with Everyone except external user (EEEU), access granted to guest users, and [more](/sharepoint/data-access-governance-site-permissions-report#what-does-the-site-permissions-report-show-me).
You [can create, view and download this report](/sharepoint/data-access-governance-site-permissions-report) from SharePoint Admin Center portal as well as PowerShell.

--- [Chunk 2 | Source: data-access-governance-site-permissions-report.md] ---
The site permissions for your organization report captures your organization's permission state at a specific point in time, giving you a complete overview of:
- **Total permissioned users**: All unique users who can access the site and its content at site level and item level. This helps you compare sites and identify those with the broadest exposure.
- **Microsoft Entra groups**: Number of cloud-only groups with permissions at all scopes. This helps you understand how group-based access contributes to overall exposure.
- **Broken inheritance**: Reveals how many items have unique permissions that override the site's default settings.
- **Everyone except external users (EEEU) permissions**: Content shared with all internal users
- **Everyone permissions**: Content shared with all users, including guests
- **Guest user permissions**: Access granted to guests marked with #EXT# in their identities
- **External participant permissions**: Access for external users who can sign in with their own credentials  
- **Sharing links**: Counts the number of:
  - Anyone links
  - People in your organization links
...and more. For the complete list of metrics captured in the report, see the [Download the site permissions for your organization reports](#download-the-site-permissions-for-your-organization-reports) section later in this article.

--- [Chunk 3 | Source: data-access-governance-site-permissions-report.md] ---
We recommend running the site permissions for your organization report in combination with other Data access governance reports, to get a complete and ongoing picture of your organization's data access landscape. Here's how to use them together effectively:
1. **Start with snapshot reports**: Run site permissions for your organization and for your users reports, along with sensitivity label reports first to understand your baseline permission structure and identify sites with the broadest exposure. We recommend running these reports quarterly to maintain a comprehensive view of your organization's data access.
2. **Follow up with activity reports**: Use sharing links and EEEU activity reports to monitor recent oversharing activities and catch emerging risks. We recommend running these monthly to stay on top of ongoing sharing activities.

--- [Chunk 2 | Source: get-ready-copilot-sharepoint-advanced-management.md] ---
To ensure assistance provided by Copilot is appropriate, accurate, and compliant, as your organization’s SharePoint admin, it's crucial for you to ensure that your organization’s data in SharePoint is appropriately governed from the following three aspects:
- **Manage content sprawl**: Reduce content duplication and ensure well-planned content creation. Ensure all sites and content are well managed governed by site owners.
- **Prevent content oversharing and control content access**: Use tools available to SharePoint admins and site owners to prevent users from oversharing content. Limit content access by Copilot with user group settings, and other tools. 
- **Manage content lifecycle**: Remove inactive and outdated content and sites. Make sure the information Copilot access is accurate and up to date.

--- [Chunk 3 | Source: create-sharepoint-site-ownership-policy.md] ---
Different organizations have different needs. Site ownership policies allow you to customize how ownership is determined by allowing you to:
- Choose who is considered responsible for managing a site in your organization - site owners or site admins or both.  
- Define the minimum number of owners or admins a site should have, currently up to 2.
The policy identifies all sites that aren't compliant with the configured ownership criteria and generate the report. If your policy is active, email notifications would then be sent for identified sites.  
We recommend choosing 2 as the minimum owner count so that sites with a single owner are identified and another owner is added immediately. Having more than one site owner can help to reduce the risk of sites becoming ownerless.

Site owners are the critical role on point for executing governance tasks at scale. Specifically, you need site owners to:
- Help attest if inactive sites are still needed in next step - **cleaning up unused sites**. 
- Perform [Site Access Reviews](/sharepoint/site-access-review#review-everyone-except-external-users-site-access-review-requests-for-site-owners) to confirm whether potentially overshared content is indeed being overshared and take remediation to address oversharing risks in Step 4 – control access. 
It's essential to confirm all sites have valid owners before cleaning up unused sites and asking owners to take care of overshared content. SharePoint Advanced Management's [Site Ownership policy](/sharepoint/create-sharepoint-site-ownership-policy) helps identify ownerless sites and find the appropriate owners when needed.
- You can run a Site Ownership policy in Simulation mode to identify any sites that don't have a minimum of two owners.
- Set up the policy in simulation mode to identify owners based on your desired criteria. Then upgrade the policy to Active mode to enable notifications to site owner candidates.","[{""search_score"": 0.02708333358168602, ""reranker_score"": 3.204486131668091, ""id"": ""49f8f373a714_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9nZXQtcmVhZHktY29waWxvdC1zaGFyZXBvaW50LWFkdmFuY2VkLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQubWQ7MTY1_pages_0"", ""title"": ""get-ready-copilot-sharepoint-advanced-management.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.0125577412545681, ""reranker_score"": 3.0868024826049805, ""id"": ""350d01f734e8_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9nZXQtcmVhZHktY29waWxvdC1zaGFyZXBvaW50LWFkdmFuY2VkLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQubWQ7Mg2_pages_0"", ""title"": ""get-ready-copilot-sharepoint-advanced-management.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.019950825721025467, ""reranker_score"": 3.0825488567352295, ""id"": ""ea6ba612037f_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9jcmVhdGUtc2hhcmVwb2ludC1zaXRlLW93bmVyc2hpcC1wb2xpY3kubWQ7Ng2_pages_0"", ""title"": ""create-sharepoint-site-ownership-policy.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.017501171678304672, ""reranker_score"": 3.0697879791259766, ""id"": ""ea6ba612037f_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9jcmVhdGUtc2hhcmVwb2ludC1zaXRlLW93bmVyc2hpcC1wb2xpY3kubWQ7MQ2_pages_0"", ""title"": ""create-sharepoint-site-ownership-policy.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.028739120811223984, ""reranker_score"": 3.0690789222717285, ""id"": ""350d01f734e8_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9nZXQtcmVhZHktY29waWxvdC1zaGFyZXBvaW50LWFkdmFuY2VkLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQubWQ7NQ2_pages_0"", ""title"": ""get-ready-copilot-sharepoint-advanced-management.md""}]"

The site lifecycle management features from [Microsoft SharePoint Advanced Management](/sharepoint/advanced-management) let you improve site governance by having automated policies configured in the [SharePoint admin center](get-started-new-admin-center.md). Site ownership policies, part of SharePoint's site lifecycle management features, help you automatically monitor and enforce site ownership requirements across your organization. These policies allow you to define who should be responsible for each site, set minimum owner or admin counts, and automate notifications when sites do not meet your criteria. By regularly identifying noncompliant sites and prompting users to take action, site ownership policies support effective site management, reduce the risk of ownerless sites, and help maintain security and compliance in your SharePoint environment.

--- [Chunk 2 | Source: data-access-governance-everyone-except-external-user-report.md] ---
We recommend running the EEEU activity reports in combination with other Data access governance reports, especially the site permissions report, to get a complete and ongoing picture of your organization's data access landscape. Here's how:
1. **Start with snapshot reports**: Run site permissions reports first to understand your baseline permission structure, specifically, to get the current state of EEEU sharing.
2. **Follow up with activity reports**: Run the EEEU activity reports to monitor recent EEEU sharing activities and catch emerging risks. We recommend running these monthly to stay on top of ongoing sharing activities.

""Everyone except external users"" is a special group that doesn't appear in the Microsoft 365 admin center, and ""Company Administrator"" acts like a group but is a role in Microsoft Entra ID.   
 **Everyone except external users** All users added to your organization automatically become members of ""Everyone except external users"". Note that you can't change default permissions granted to ""Everyone except external users"" on Microsoft 365 group-connected team sites. If a group-connected team site is set to ""Public"", ""Everyone except external users"" has a default permission level of ""Edit"". When a group-connected team site is set to ""Private"", ""Everyone except external users"" can be manually added to the site through ""Site permissions"". To change the privacy setting for a group-connected team site, select the Settings icon, and then select **Site information**.   
 **Company Administrator** This group contains all users who are assigned the global admin role. For more info about this role and its permissions in Microsoft Entra ID, see [Company administrator](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#company-administrator). The root site for your organization is created with ""Company Administrator"" as the primary admin.

'Everyone except external users' (EEEU) is a built-in SharePoint group that automatically includes all internal users but excludes any external guests. The 'Everyone except external users' (EEEU) report is one of the two types of Data access governance activity reports available with [SharePoint Advanced Management](advanced-management.md). The EEEU activity reports help you identify sites where content is shared with your entire organization in the past 28 days. We recommend running the  [site permissions report](data-access-governance-site-permissions-report.md) first to understand your organization's current EEEU sharing baseline, then use the EEEU activity report to monitor ongoing EEEU sharing activities.

Regularly reviewing and archiving inactive sites is essential for keeping your SharePoint environment clean and efficient, and it also helps prevent Microsoft 365 Copilot from accessing outdated or inaccurate information. Inactive sites often contain obsolete content that can negatively impact Copilot’s responses, leading to less relevant or incorrect results for users. Use the [Inactive Site policy](/sharepoint/site-lifecycle-management#create-an-inactive-site-policy) to identify sites that haven't been accessed for a specified period. Notify site owners and site admins to review these sites and decide whether to archive them, ensuring that Copilot only draws from current, relevant, and active content.

Regularly reviewing and archiving inactive sites is essential for keeping your SharePoint environment clean and efficient, and it also helps prevent Microsoft 365 Copilot from accessing outdated or inaccurate information. Inactive sites often contain obsolete content that can negatively impact Copilot’s responses, leading to less relevant or incorrect results for users.

Identify inactive sites, then take action to reduce your governance footprint and improve Copilot response quality. Inactive sites often contain outdated content, cluttering Copilot’s data source and leading to less accurate responses. Removing these sites helps Copilot focus on current information for better results. Currently, you can identify unused sites by running an inactive site policy and ask site owners to attest if the site is still needed.
- With less than five minutes you can set up and run an [Inactive Site policy](/sharepoint/site-lifecycle-management#create-an-inactive-site-policy) in Simulation mode to identify sites that haven't been accessed for an extended (configurable) period of time.
- Once the report is generated, select the Get AI insights button to [get AI insights](/sharepoint/advanced-management#ai-insights) generated for the report to help you identify issues with the sites and possible actions to address these issues.
- After identifying inactive sites, set the policy to Active mode to notify the Site Owner to attest whether the site is still needed.
- If the site owners confirm the sites aren't needed, you need to put the sites either in [read-only mode](/sharepoint/site-lifecycle-management#read-only-mode). These sites will be moved to [Microsoft 365 Archive](/microsoft-365/archive/archive-overview) after a configurable duration (3, 6, 9, or 12 months). 
> [!TIP]
> Sites moved to Microsoft 365 Archive are no longer accessible by anyone in the organization outside of Microsoft Purview or admin search. This means Copilot won't include content from these sites when responding to user prompts.

In the modern world, the intranet should be the center of your workplace. An intelligent SharePoint intranet is engaging, informative, personalized, and integrated with the other portals and sites in your intranet as well as other Microsoft 365 apps like Microsoft Teams and Viva Engage. Modern intranets take many shapes and sizes depending on the ever-evolving needs of the business.
Hallmarks of what constitutes an intelligent intranet:
- **Rapid deployment**: Adaptable designs can be built using out of the box pages and web parts and no longer solely depends on IT to deploy.
- **Built with the UX in mind**: Accessible design principals are built into the modern experience enabling viewers to securely access the intranet on any device.
- **Personalized experience**: Features like audience targeting, news, the Highlighted Content web part, and the My Feed web part make it easy to dynamically display personalized content.
- **Software as a service**: Updates are automatic, ensuring you are using the latest technology.

- Identify your key sponsors and stakeholders and review key organizational priorities. Document a vision that will help provide direction and help you prioritize opportunities.
- Align key outcome goals with SharePoint capabilities to identify where you may need to invest in customization. Consider whether an “intranet in a box” solution might be appropriate for your organization.
- Think about governance. What processes will you need to create to provision, manage, and maintain sites and content? Do you have security, retention, or compliance goals that need to be considered?
- Think about branding and architecture—do you want all sites to share a common look and feel?
- Analyze possible opportunities to identify priorities.

The SharePoint brand center offers a centralized branding management application that empowers your brand managers or designated brand owners to help your organization to customize the look and feel of their experiences.
With this new brand asset management system, you can handle your colors, fonts, and images, and other assets all in one place.

--- [Chunk 2 | Source: brand-center-overview.md] ---
The brand center uses the SharePoint Organization Asset Library (OAL) to store and manage assets in the background. The brand center app is located in a designated site within your tenant.
> [!NOTE]
> The SharePoint brand center currently only allows one brand center for your organization, and the Global Administrator sets it up.
The brand center app lets you access and manage your organization's brand assets from one central place. By using the brand center app, you can make sure that your organization's brand identity is coherent and professional in all your communication channels. You can also save time and resources by avoiding duplication and confusion of brand assets, and by empowering your employees to create high-quality branded content.

--- [Chunk 3 | Source: brand-center-overview.md] ---
Every organization has a set of brand assets that are important for expressing its brand identity. Brand assets are the things that give your brand its distinctive look, sound, and feel. They include your logo, colors, fonts, images, voice, and guidelines. You use your brand assets to show your brand personality and style in all the places where you communicate with your customers, such as websites, social media, marketing materials, presentations, and products. When you use your brand assets well, you make your brand more memorable, trustworthy, and unique.
One of the challenges of managing brand assets is to ensure consistency and quality across different platforms and devices. You want your brand to look sharp and professional everywhere, without spending too much time and effort on resizing, formatting, or providing appropriate access to your users.
The SharePoint brand center makes the management of brand assets simple across the Microsoft 365 product ecosystem. This centralized management system enables both asset management along with customization for how the assets are utilized within each product.

--- [Chunk 4 | Source: brand-center-overview.md] ---
The SharePoint brand center includes two levels of management: the Microsoft 365 Admin Center and the Brand Center associated SharePoint site. Within the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, the global administrator has control over the enablement of the Brand Center and easy access to the associated site with management in the SharePoint Admin Center.
From the Brand center associated site, [SharePoint site owners](/sharepoint/site-permissions#site-owners) and [above](/sharepoint/site-permissions) can update the site permissions in the SharePoint Admin Center such as adding more brand managers to the experience. You can do this by adding members to the site owners’ group. Within the app itself, the brand managers are able to upload and manage their organization’s brand assets.

A font isn't just a way of writing. It's a visual feature that connects your content to your brand and expresses your tone and character. A font can give your content a professional, creative, friendly, or authoritative appearance, depending on the typeface, size, color, and spacing you use.
For SharePoint and Viva Connections experiences, an organization uses the SharePoint brand center to control your organization’s fonts. This helps you make sure that your font selections are coherent and match your brand identity and guidelines.

To enable the new brand center the global administrator needs to perform a set of simple steps in the Microsoft 365 admin center to create/activate the Brand center app. The brand center app requires the use of Public CDN.
The brand center administrative experience finds the site that has your organization’s existing organization asset libraries if you're using them and base your brand center on this site. If you aren't using the organization asset library feature, we'll prompt you to make a new site to be your brand center.
When you turn on the SharePoint brand center for your organization, this lets you use the custom fonts feature in SharePoint and Viva Connections. You can find more details in the Message Center post for Custom Fonts.
To enable the SharePoint brand center, the global administrator needs to perform a few simple steps in the Microsoft 365 admin center to create/activate the Brand center app.
The steps required depend on your current tenant configuration. The following describes steps you need to do for each of the three scenarios:
- Scenario 1: Your tenant doesn't currently utilize the SharePoint Organization Assets feature.
- Scenario 2: Your tenant uses the SharePoint Organization Assets feature with Private CDN.
- Scenario 3: Your tenant uses the SharePoint Organization Assets feature with Public CDN.
![Screenshot of accessing brand center from microsofto 365 admin center.](media/mac-brand-center.png)
**Scenario 1:** Your tenant doesn't currently utilize the SharePoint Organization Assets feature.
For this scenario, the global administrator performs the following steps to create the Brand center app.
1. In the admin center, go to **Settings \> Org settings**.
1. Select **Brand center**.
1. Choose site name for the Brand Center site – Suggested “Brand Guide”.
1. Read and give consent to the use of Public CDN in your tenant for the Brand center.
1. Create the site and configure Public CDN in your tenant.

1. The Brand center recognizes your existing organization assets site location and will utilize this as the location for the Brand center app.
1. Activate the Brand center app for your organization.
1. Copy and share the link to the Brand center site/app to your site owners to unlock the Brand center app.
After you finish setting up your SharePoint brand center, you can control who can access the brand center app by customizing the site permissions of the brand center site. Site owners of the brand center site will be able to use the brand center app.

One of the challenges of managing brand assets across geographies is ensuring consistency and compliance with local regulations and cultural preferences. Brand managers need to be able to adapt their brand assets to different markets and languages, while still maintaining a unified and recognizable brand identity.
The SharePoint brand center currently only creates a single brand center app in the primary geo of a tenant. We haven’t changed anything about how this impacts the current multi-geo operations for Organization Asset Image or Template Libraries. However, for custom fonts to work across geographies, the following requirements must be met:
> Each additional geography where custom fonts are wanted must have an organization asset library set up in a site that uses the Public CDN. Once these requirements are met, custom fonts show up in the **Change the Look** panel and will work in that geography.
> [!NOTE]
> This does not impact Organization Asset Image Libraries and Template Libraries.

--- [Chunk 5 | Source: brand-fonts.md] ---
After choosing your custom brand font, you'll need to upload it into the SharePoint brand center so that it can be part of your font packages. You'll go to the Brand Fonts library from the Brand center app.
1.  Download or locate your custom brand font files. These often come in .zip folders.
1.  If the font files are zipped, unzip them by right-clicking the .zip folder and then clicking **Extract**.
1.  Navigate to the Brand fonts library in the SharePoint brand center app. Using the upload button

The B2B Sync feature in the OneDrive sync app lets users sync libraries or folders in Microsoft SharePoint or Microsoft OneDrive that were shared from other organizations. This scenario is often referred to as Business-to-Business (B2B) Collaboration.
Microsoft Entra guest accounts play a key role in making B2B Collaboration possible. A guest account at one organization links to a member account at another organization. Once created, a guest account allows Microsoft 365 services like OneDrive and SharePoint to grant a guest permission to sites and folders the same way a member within the organization is granted permission. Since the accounts at two organizations are linked, the user only needs to remember the username and password for the account at their organization. As a result, a single sign-in to their account enables access to content from their own organization and from any other organizations that created guest accounts for them.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend that you enable [SharePoint and OneDrive integration with Microsoft Entra B2B](/sharepoint/sharepoint-azureb2b-integration) to help ensure that the required Microsoft Entra guest account for the share recipient is created in your organization's directory.

The B2B Sync feature of the OneDrive sync app lets users at an organization to sync OneDrive and SharePoint libraries and folders shared with them from another organization. For more information, see [B2B Sync](b2b-sync.md).
Enabling this setting prevents users at your organization from being able to use B2B Sync. After the setting is enabled (by entering value 1) on a computer, the sync app doesn't sync libraries and folders shared from other organizations. Modify the setting to the disabled state (by entering value 0) to restore B2B Sync capability for your users.
Prevent B2B Sync with:

The B2B Sync feature of the OneDrive sync app allows users at an organization to sync content shared with them from another organization. If you wish to prevent users at your organization from being able to use B2B Sync, you can set a policy value on your users' Windows PC or Mac to block external sync.
You only need to take these actions if you wish to prevent users at your organization from using the B2B Sync feature (to prevent syncing libraries and folders shared from other organizations).
The new BlockExternalSync setting is described in the adm\OneDrive.admx and OneDrive.adml files installed as part of the OneDrive sync product build 19.086.* or higher. If you use ADM to manage your sync app policies, import the new files as you normally would in order to see the new setting.
If you're using other management systems to deploy policies to your users' Windows PCs, use the equivalent of the following command to prevent B2B Sync:
```cmd
reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\OneDrive"" /v BlockExternalSync /t REG_DWORD /d 1
```
On a Mac with the Apple Store version of OneDrive, use the equivalent of the following command to prevent B2B Sync:
```cmd
defaults write com.microsoft.OneDrive-mac BlockExternalSync -bool YES
```
On a Mac with the Standalone version of OneDrive, use the equivalent of the following command to prevent B2B Sync:
```cmd
defaults write com.microsoft.OneDrive BlockExternalSync -bool YES
```

Sites and folders can be shared in different ways in SharePoint and OneDrive:
- If users are syncing a folder, they can right-click it in File Explorer to share it.
- Users can go to the SharePoint site or folder on the web and select the Share button to share it.
- Users can share sites and folders in the SharePoint and OneDrive mobile apps.
- Admins can create guest accounts and use the admin center or PowerShell to add them to sites.
> [!NOTE]

B2B Sync works with all these methods of sharing. It has only the following requirements:
- For guests to sync shared content, the content must be shared at the site or folder level. Guests can't sync files that are shared individually (for example, from the Office apps).
- B2B sync works only when guest accounts are created in the organization, and when the recipient has a Microsoft Entra account. It doesn't work when users share by creating an Anyone link (also known as ""anonymous access"" link), or when they share with people who have a Microsoft account or other personal account.

Here's an example of what happens after someone at ""Contoso"" shares a site or folder with someone at ""Fabrikam"":
1. The Fabrikam recipient receives an email like the following.
    ![A sharing invitation email](media/sharing-invitation.png)
2. When the recipient selects the link in the email to go to the shared item, they need to select ""Organizational account"" to sign in with their Fabrikam account. Behind the scenes, this creates the Contoso guest account in Microsoft Entra ID.
    ![Accepting an invitation](media/accept-invitation.png)
3. The recipient may need to enter their Fabrikam username or password, and then they can view the shared item. If they don't want to sync everything that was shared, they can browse to the library or folder they want to sync. To set up syncing, they need to select the Sync button.
    ![The Sync button in a SharePoint document library](media/sync-button.png)
4. The guest's browser displays up a message asking if they want to open ""Microsoft OneDrive,"" and they'll need to allow this.
5. If this is the first time the guest has used the sync app with their Fabrikam account, they need to sign in. The email address is automatically set to the Fabrikam account used in the previous steps. The guest needs to select ""Sign in.""
6. The guest might be able to sign in to the sync app without entering their Fabrikam password if they're signed in to Windows with the same account. Otherwise they need to enter their password.
7. The guest confirms where they want to sync the shared item on their computer.
    > [!NOTE]
    > The content is placed in a folder whose name includes the name of the organization (""SharePoint - Contoso"" in this example). If the user is syncing SharePoint content from Fabrikam as well, they'll also have a ""SharePoint - Fabrikam"" folder.

When you allow users to share content from your organization externally, you can use several features in Microsoft 365 to manage who has access to the content. Admins and site owners can review permissions and audit access to sites. For info, see [Searching for site content shared with people outside your organization](/microsoft-365/compliance/keyword-queries-and-search-conditions#searching-for-site-content-shared-with-external-users) and [Turn on external sharing notifications](turn-on-external-sharing-notifications.md). You can enable external sharing with only specific internet domains, or you can block specific domains. For info, see [Restricted domains sharing](/sharepoint/restricted-domains-sharing). You can also allow only members of specific security groups to share externally. For info, see [Turn external sharing on or off](/sharepoint/turn-external-sharing-on-or-off).
We recommend creating separate sites (site collections, not subsites) for each unit of work that you want to share externally. This way, you can clearly annotate the sites to indicate that people outside the organization have access, and avoid unintentional disclosure of information. For individual users sharing content from their OneDrive, we recommend creating separate folders for different projects or collaboration groups.
You can remove a guest's permission to a site or folder, or you can delete the guest account to remove their permission from all of your organization's content.

Sites and folders can be shared in different ways in SharePoint and OneDrive:
- If users are syncing a folder, they can right-click it in File Explorer to share it.
- Users can go to the SharePoint site or folder on the web and select the Share button to share it.
- Users can share sites and folders in the SharePoint and OneDrive mobile apps.
- Admins can create guest accounts and use the admin center or PowerShell to add them to sites.
> [!NOTE]
> For more info about these methods, see [Learn how to share a site](https://support.office.com/article/958771a8-d041-4eb8-b51c-afea2eae3658) and [Learn how to share a folder](https://support.office.com/article/1fe37332-0f9a-4719-970e-d2578da4941c).
B2B Sync works with all these methods of sharing. It has only the following requirements:
- For guests to sync shared content, the content must be shared at the site or folder level. Guests can't sync files that are shared individually (for example, from the Office apps).
- B2B sync works only when guest accounts are created in the organization, and when the recipient has a Microsoft Entra account. It doesn't work when users share by creating an Anyone link (also known as ""anonymous access"" link), or when they share with people who have a Microsoft account or other personal account.

--- [Chunk 2 | Source: b2b-sync.md] ---
- Sync between users in different clouds isn't supported For example, content shared from a tenant in Microsoft Azure China 21Vianet isn't synched for a user with a Microsoft Azure Commercial cloud.
- On the Mac, Files On-Demand thumbnails won't display from external organization's sites. Thumbnails display correctly for files from the user's own organization.
- On the Mac, if the guest account was created with a different email address format than the form they're using with the sync app, the external site's content can't be synced. For example, <first.last@fabrikam.com> vs <alias@fabrikam.com>.
- On Mac, the external content can be placed on the local computer in the user's own organization's folder instead of one with the external organization's name.
- Interactive authentication UI for guest accounts from an external organization isn't supported by the sync client.

--- [Chunk 3 | Source: b2b-sync.md] ---
The tenant admin can enable several kinds of conditional access policies at their tenant. When a guest is going to access a tenant's content, those policies may need to be adjusted for the guests so they can gain access.
- Currently the sync client doesn't support interactive authentication UI when syncing external content. Any policy that would require a sign-in UI such as MFA (multifactor authentication) or TOU (terms of use) prompt, will prevent the syncing of the external content from that tenant. If a tenant admin deploys such a policy before a guest starts syncing from that tenant, the user is unable to establish the sync relationship. If the policy is deployed after a guest is syncing content from the tenant, that guest will receive an error and be unable to continue to sync from the tenant.
- Tenants may update their Terms of Use (TOU) from time to time. A policy can trigger the user to view and accept the updated TOU via an interactive authentication prompt. Since sync doesn't support external tenant sign-in UI, sync indicates it's unable to sync the external site's content.
- Device Compliance requires user machines to be managed by the tenant and then to be up to date with requirements. For guests, their machines are likely to be managed by their own organization and thus are incompatible with requiring their machines to be managed by the content sharing tenant.
- Location-based conditional access policies are typically used to enforce more requirements like MFA when the user isn't connecting from a trusted location (such as the tenant's office network). Typically in a guest scenario the client machine won't be located at the trusted locations, and since sync doesn't support MFA, you likely don't want this policy to apply to your guests.

In order for users at your organization to be able to share with their partners at other organizations, external sharing must be enabled at the organization level. To do this, you must be a global or SharePoint admin in Microsoft 365. After you enable external sharing at the organization level, you can restrict it site by site. A site's settings can be the same as the organization setting, or more restrictive, but not more permissive.
You can change your organization-level sharing settings in two different places (both control the same thing):
- On the Sharing page in the new SharePoint admin center. For more info, see [Change the organization-level external sharing setting](/sharepoint/turn-external-sharing-on-or-off#change-the-organization-level-external-sharing-setting)
- In the Microsoft 365 admin center, on the Org settings page > SharePoint.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you allow Anyone links (sometimes referred to as ""anonymous access"" links), these links don't create guest accounts and therefore the external share recipient won't be able to use B2B Sync when receiving that link type.
For more info, see [External sharing overview](/sharepoint/external-sharing-overview).

The B2B Sync feature of the OneDrive sync app lets users at an organization to sync OneDrive and SharePoint libraries and folders shared with them from another organization. For more information, see [B2B Sync](b2b-sync.md).
Enabling this setting prevents users at your organization from being able to use B2B Sync. After the setting is enabled (by entering value 1) on a computer, the sync app doesn't sync libraries and folders shared from other organizations. Modify the setting to the disabled state (by entering value 0) to restore B2B Sync capability for your users.

When you first signed up for Microsoft 365, you created an onmicrosoft.com domain. Even if you later added a custom domain, the original onmicrosoft.com domain is used for all your SharePoint and OneDrive URLs. 
If your organization is going through a rebranding, merger, or acquisition and needs to change the domain in your SharePoint and OneDrive URLs, you can change the domain name using PowerShell. For example, if your organization name changed from Contoso to Fabrikam, you can change your SharePoint URLs from `contoso.sharepoint.com` to `fabrikam.sharepoint.com`.

> - When the rename operation begins, all sites in the tenant are queued for individual renames to the new domain. While the renaming is happening, sites that are on the original domain would be temporarily inaccessible. Once each site is renamed to the new domain, it becomes accessible again.
> - The standard version of the renaming feature is currently available to organizations that have no more than 10,000 total sites, which includes SharePoint sites, OneDrive accounts and SharePoint Embedded containers combined. 
> - Advanced Tenant Rename is available to organizations with any number of sites, available with SharePoint Advanced Management. See [Advanced Tenant Rename](change-your-sharepoint-domain-name.md#advanced-tenant-rename).
> - The domain name change affects only SharePoint and OneDrive URLs. It doesn't impact email addresses.

> - Changing your SharePoint domain name back to the original name after you rename it isn't supported. For example, if you change your SharePoint domain from `contoso.sharepoint.com` to `fabrikam.sharepoint.com`, changing it back to `contoso.sharepoint.com` isn't supported.
> - A redirect site is created for each site rename and each redirect takes 0.15 MB. So, an organization should readily have '0.15MB * no. of sites' amount of storage available on the tenant before they rename.

1. Check the availability of the new domain you want. For example, if you want your SharePoint and OneDrive URLs to begin with `fabrikam.sharepoint.com`, enter `https://fabrikam.sharepoint.com` in a browser. If you get a message that the address couldn’t be found (404), it's probably available. If you get a sign-in screen or a message that your username couldn’t be found in the fabrikam.sharepoint.com directory, then the domain is taken and you need to try a different one. If the domain is already registered by another customer, we can't provide any information or contact the customer. 
    -or-
    If you own the domain for another subscription, you need to [delete that tenant in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/directory-delete-howto). Deleting a tenant typically takes three days to complete and to make the domain available. 
    > [!WARNING]
    > Do NOT use the domain to test this procedure in a test environment first. If you do, you won't be able to use the domain for your production environment.
2. Add your [new .onmicrosoft.com domain using the Domains page in the M365 Admin Center](/microsoft-365/admin/setup/add-or-replace-your-onmicrosoftcom-domain#add-a-new-onmicrosoftcom-domain). 
     - Don't use the ""Add domain"" option directly present in the Domains page, since that doesn't create a .onmicrosoft.com domain. Use the steps in the link above to correctly create one.
     - Don't make this domain your fallback domain.    
3.

For more info about the Start-SPOTenantRename cmdlet, see [Start-SPOTenantRename](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/start-spotenantrename)
    To cancel a rename before it starts, you can run `Stop-SPOTenantRename`. [More info about this cmdlet](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/start-spotenantrename).

When you first signed up for Microsoft 365, you created an onmicrosoft.com domain. Even if you later added a custom domain, the original onmicrosoft.com domain is used for all your SharePoint and OneDrive URLs. 
If your organization is going through a rebranding, merger, or acquisition and needs to change the domain in your SharePoint and OneDrive URLs, you can change the domain name using PowerShell. For example, if your organization name changed from Contoso to Fabrikam, you can change your SharePoint URLs from `contoso.sharepoint.com` to `fabrikam.sharepoint.com`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - When the rename operation begins, all sites in the tenant are queued for individual renames to the new domain. While the renaming is happening, sites that are on the original domain would be temporarily inaccessible. Once each site is renamed to the new domain, it becomes accessible again.
> - The standard version of the renaming feature is currently available to organizations that have no more than 10,000 total sites, which includes SharePoint sites, OneDrive accounts and SharePoint Embedded containers combined. 
> - Advanced Tenant Rename is available to organizations with any number of sites, available with SharePoint Advanced Management. See [Advanced Tenant Rename](change-your-sharepoint-domain-name.md#advanced-tenant-rename).
> - The domain name change affects only SharePoint and OneDrive URLs. It doesn't impact email addresses.
> - For info about changing a site address, for example, from `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/sample1` to  `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/sample2`, see [Change a site address](change-site-address.md). 
> - The domain rename feature isn't available for organizations that have set up multi-geo. This includes those that had enabled a trial or the paid offering in the past.

> - If your organization uses special clouds or government clouds (GCC, GCC High, DoD, etc.), or still has a .de domain, your domain name can't be changed.
> - When you rename your SharePoint domain, we create a redirect at the previous address, which will expire 1 year after the rename.
> - You can only rename your SharePoint domain once. If you need more renames, submit a support request by selecting [Rename a SharePoint Tenant more than once](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/?searchSolutions=Rename%20a%20SharePoint%20Tenant%20more%20than%20once).
> - Changing your SharePoint domain name back to the original name after you rename it isn't supported. For example, if you change your SharePoint domain from `contoso.sharepoint.com` to `fabrikam.sharepoint.com`, changing it back to `contoso.sharepoint.com` isn't supported.
> - A redirect site is created for each site rename and each redirect takes 0.15 MB. So, an organization should readily have '0.15MB * no. of sites' amount of storage available on the tenant before they rename.

1. Check the availability of the new domain you want. For example, if you want your SharePoint and OneDrive URLs to begin with `fabrikam.sharepoint.com`, enter `https://fabrikam.sharepoint.com` in a browser. If you get a message that the address couldn’t be found (404), it's probably available. If you get a sign-in screen or a message that your username couldn’t be found in the fabrikam.sharepoint.com directory, then the domain is taken and you need to try a different one. If the domain is already registered by another customer, we can't provide any information or contact the customer. 
    -or-
    If you own the domain for another subscription, you need to [delete that tenant in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/directory-delete-howto). Deleting a tenant typically takes three days to complete and to make the domain available. 
    > [!WARNING]
    > Do NOT use the domain to test this procedure in a test environment first. If you do, you won't be able to use the domain for your production environment.
2. Add your [new .onmicrosoft.com domain using the Domains page in the M365 Admin Center](/microsoft-365/admin/setup/add-or-replace-your-onmicrosoftcom-domain#add-a-new-onmicrosoftcom-domain). 
     - Don't use the ""Add domain"" option directly present in the Domains page, since that doesn't create a .onmicrosoft.com domain. Use the steps in the link above to correctly create one.
     - Don't make this domain your fallback domain.    
3. Go back to the Domains page and check that the newly added .onmicrosoft.com domain appears in a 'Healthy' state.","[{""search_score"": 0.03279569745063782, ""reranker_score"": 3.6844372749328613, ""id"": ""88307f7b98b9_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9jaGFuZ2UteW91ci1zaGFyZXBvaW50LWRvbWFpbi1uYW1lLm1kOzEw0_pages_0"", ""title"": ""change-your-sharepoint-domain-name.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.03030998818576336, ""reranker_score"": 3.6645870208740234, ""id"": ""88307f7b98b9_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9jaGFuZ2UteW91ci1zaGFyZXBvaW50LWRvbWFpbi1uYW1lLm1kOzEw0_pages_1"", ""title"": ""change-your-sharepoint-domain-name.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.03177805617451668, ""reranker_score"": 3.6192150115966797, ""id"": ""88307f7b98b9_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9jaGFuZ2UteW91ci1zaGFyZXBvaW50LWRvbWFpbi1uYW1lLm1kOzI1_pages_0"", ""title"": ""change-your-sharepoint-domain-name.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.03057890012860298, ""reranker_score"": 3.4157497882843018, ""id"": ""88307f7b98b9_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9jaGFuZ2UteW91ci1zaGFyZXBvaW50LWRvbWFpbi1uYW1lLm1kOzI1_pages_1"", ""title"": ""change-your-sharepoint-domain-name.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.03067915514111519, ""reranker_score"": 3.3278415203094482, ""id"": ""88307f7b98b9_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9jaGFuZ2UteW91ci1zaGFyZXBvaW50LWRvbWFpbi1uYW1lLm1kOzk1_pages_0"", ""title"": ""change-your-sharepoint-domain-name.md""}]"

Search is an important part of any site – you want people to be able to find what they're looking for quickly and easily. SharePoint has both a classic and a modern search experience. Microsoft Search in SharePoint is the modern experience. The most visible difference is that the Microsoft Search box is placed at the top of SharePoint, in the header bar. Another difference is that Microsoft Search is personal and contextual. The results you see are different from what other people see, even when you search for the same words. You'll also see different results based on where you are when you search. For example, searching at the root of your tenant looks across all of SharePoint. Searching from a hub finds content in all sites associated to the hub. Searching from an individual site finds content on that site. Searching from a list or library finds content in the list or library. You'll also see results before you start typing in the search box, based on your previous activity and trending content in Microsoft 365, and the results update as you type. To learn more about the Microsoft Search experience for users, see [Find what you need with Microsoft Search](https://support.office.com/article/d5ed5d11-9e5d-4f1d-b8b4-3d371fe0cb87). There are other differences, especially around customization. To decide which experience your organization should use, see [When to use which search experience](get-started-with-modern-search-experience.md).

SharePoint in Microsoft 365 has both a classic and a modern search experience. Microsoft Search in SharePoint is the modern search experience. Both search experiences use the same search index to find results.
As a search admin, you can’t enable or disable either search experience, both are enabled by default. Users get the classic search experience on publishing sites, classic team sites, and in the Search Center. Users get the Microsoft Search experience on the SharePoint start page, hub sites, communication sites, and modern team sites.

Search admin can customize the *classic* search experience, but not the Microsoft Search experience. As a search admin you can *tailor* Microsoft Search to your organization so it's easy for your users to find often needed content in your organization.
For example, if your organization has Microsoft Search fully deployed, custom result sources at site collection or tenant level won't affect the search result. The search admin can use Microsoft search verticals instead. To learn more, see [Manage search verticals](/microsoftsearch/manage-verticals).

Microsoft Search is the modern search experience in SharePoint in Microsoft 365 and is a personalized experience. It uses the insights of the Microsoft Graph to show results that are relevant to you. Routine tasks such as finding the right version of a document, getting back to a presentation you were editing, or a document you were collaborating with others on, are easy. [Learn more about Microsoft Search for users](https://support.office.com/article/d5ed5d11-9e5d-4f1d-b8b4-3d371fe0cb87). The classic search experience, on the other hand, can be tailored more to your organization. [Learn about the differences between the search experiences](differences-classic-modern-search.md).
Both search experiences are turned on by default and as a search administrator you can't turn either search experience off.
Which search experience your users see depends on where they search from:
- Users get the classic search experience on publishing sites, classic team sites, and in the Search Center.
- Users get the Microsoft Search experience on the SharePoint start page, hub sites, communication sites, and modern team sites. [Learn about classic and modern sites](https://support.office.com/article/5725c103-505d-4a6e-9350-300d3ec7d73f).
  If you're in a document library, the search box shows **Search this library**. If you're in the home page of the site, the box shows **Search this site**. In all other locations, the search box shows **Search**.

This high-level overview of how search works can help you understand where and how you can customize the search in SharePoint.   
In lists and libraries, site columns store detailed information about each document.  
1. Search **crawls** the lists and libraries and adds the site columns and values to the search index.
2. In the **search index**, site columns are mapped to [managed properties](/sharepoint/manage-search-schema#managed-properties-and-search).
3. When a user enters a **query** in a search box, the query is sent to the search index. 
4. The search engine finds **matching results**, and sends them to a search results page.

For each virtual machine running SQL Server, use the remote desktop client of your choice and create a remote desktop connection. Use its intranet DNS or computer name and the credentials of the local administrator account.  
For each virtual machine running SQL Server, join them to the appropriate Windows Server AD domain with these commands at the Windows PowerShell prompt.  
```
$domName=""<Windows Server AD domain name to join, such as corp.contoso.com>""
Add-Computer -DomainName $domName
Restart-Computer

```
Note that you must supply domain account credentials after entering the **Add-Computer** command.   
After they restart, reconnect to them using the local administrator account.  
Next, you need to add the extra data disks. Run these commands from a Windows PowerShell command prompt on each SQL server computer:  
```
$newDisks=Get-Disk | Where Partitionstyle -eq ""RAW""
ForEach ($d in $newDisks) {
$diskNum=$d.Number - 1
Get-Disk $d.Number | Initialize-Disk -PartitionStyle GPT -PassThru | New-Partition -AssignDriveLetter -UseMaximumSize | Format-Volume -FileSystem NTFS -NewFileSystemLabel ""DataDisk$diskNum""
}
md f:\Data
md g:\Log
md h:\Backup

```
Next, test each SQL server computer's connectivity to locations on your organization network by using the **ping** command to ping names and IP addresses of resources on your organization network. This procedure ensures that DNS name resolution is working correctly (that the virtual machine is correctly configured with DNS servers in the virtual network) and that packets can be sent to and from the cross-premises virtual network.   
Run the following PowerShell command block twice, once for each SQL server, to configure them to use the extra drives for new databases and for accounts and permissions:  
```
$domain = ""<your Windows Server AD domain name, such as CORP for corp.contoso.com>""
$spFarmDBAcctName=$domain +""\sp_farm_db""
$spFarmInstallAcctName=$domain +""\sp_install""

The following are known issues with this release:  
- If you create a new access policy after the device has authenticated, it may take up to 24 hours for the policy to take effect.
- In some cases, the user may be prompted for credentials twice. We're working on a fix for this issue.
- Certain AD FS configurations may require additional setup to work with this release. Run the following command on your AD FS server to ensure FormsAuthentication is added to the list of PrimaryIntranetAuthenticationProvider:
     `Set-AdfsGlobalAuthenticationPolicy -PrimaryIntranetAuthenticationProvider @('WindowsAuthentication', 'FormsAuthentication')`
- If you enable location-based conditional access, users get a prompt about every 90 to 120 minutes by default when they leave the set of approved IP address ranges. The exact timing depends on the access token expiry duration (60 minutes by default), when their computer last obtained a new access token, and any specific conditional access timeouts put in place.

Some apps don't work with authentication contexts. We recommend testing apps on a site with authentication context enabled before broadly deploying this feature.
The following apps and scenarios don't work with authentication contexts:
- Older version of Office apps (see the [list of supported versions](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-teams-groups-sites#more-information-about-the-dependencies-for-the-authentication-context-option))
- SharePoint mobile apps (iOS and Android)
- Viva Engage
- OneNote app can't be added to channel if the associated SharePoint site has an authentication context.
- Teams channel meeting recording upload fails on sites with an authentication context.
- SharePoint folder renaming in Teams fails if the site has an authentication context.
- Teams webinar scheduling fails if OneDrive has an authentication context.
- The OneDrive sync app won't sync sites with an authentication context.
- Associating an authentication context to the enterprise application catalog site collection isn't supported.
- The “Visualize SharePoint List in Power BI” feature doesn't currently support authentication context.
- Outlook on Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS don't support communication with SharePoint sites protected by an Authentication Context.
- The multiple-file download feature currently doesn't function when both the authentication context and 'Use Conditional Access App Control' in session control are enabled in the conditional access policy.
- The file copy and move feature between different regions (cross-geo) currently doesn’t function when an authentication context is applied to the destination site.
- Exporting to Excel as an Excel Web Query (IQY) doesn't currently support authentication context.

The following parameters can be used with  `-ConditionalAccessPolicy AllowLimitedAccess` for both the organization-wide setting and the site-level setting:
 `-AllowEditing $false` Prevents users from editing Office files in the browser.
 `-ReadOnlyForUnmanagedDevices $true` Makes the entire site read-only for impacted users.
 `-LimitedAccessFileType OfficeOnlineFilesOnly` Allows users to preview only Office files in the browser. This option increases security but may be a barrier to user productivity.
 `-LimitedAccessFileType WebPreviewableFiles` (default) Allows users to preview Office files in the browser. This option optimizes for user productivity but offers less security for files that aren't Office files. **Warning:** This option is known to cause problems with PDF and image file types because they can be required to be downloaded to the end user's machine to render in the browser. Plan the use of this control carefully. Otherwise, your users could be faced with unexpected ""Access Denied"" errors.
 `-LimitedAccessFileType OtherFiles` Allows users to download files that can't be previewed, such as .zip and .exe. This option offers less security. If this mode is enabled, then for downloading files like .zip or .exe, you can copy the url of the file and paste in browser (example: `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/test/Shared%20Documents/test1.zip`).
The `AllowDownlownloadingNonWebViewableFiles` parameter is no longer supported. Use `LimitedAccessFileType` instead.
People outside the organization will be affected when you use conditional access policies to block or limit access from unmanaged devices. If users have shared items with specific people (who must enter a verification code sent to their email address), you can exempt them from this policy by running the following command.
```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -ApplyAppEnforcedRestrictionsToAdHocRecipients $false
```

The tenant admin can enable several kinds of conditional access policies at their tenant. When a guest is going to access a tenant's content, those policies may need to be adjusted for the guests so they can gain access.
- Currently the sync client doesn't support interactive authentication UI when syncing external content. Any policy that would require a sign-in UI such as MFA (multifactor authentication) or TOU (terms of use) prompt, will prevent the syncing of the external content from that tenant. If a tenant admin deploys such a policy before a guest starts syncing from that tenant, the user is unable to establish the sync relationship. If the policy is deployed after a guest is syncing content from the tenant, that guest will receive an error and be unable to continue to sync from the tenant.
- Tenants may update their Terms of Use (TOU) from time to time. A policy can trigger the user to view and accept the updated TOU via an interactive authentication prompt. Since sync doesn't support external tenant sign-in UI, sync indicates it's unable to sync the external site's content.
- Device Compliance requires user machines to be managed by the tenant and then to be up to date with requirements. For guests, their machines are likely to be managed by their own organization and thus are incompatible with requiring their machines to be managed by the content sharing tenant.
- Location-based conditional access policies are typically used to enforce more requirements like MFA when the user isn't connecting from a trusted location (such as the tenant's office network). Typically in a guest scenario the client machine won't be located at the trusted locations, and since sync doesn't support MFA, you likely don't want this policy to apply to your guests.
For more information, see [Authentication and Conditional Access for External Identities](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/authentication-conditional-access).

Microsoft OneDrive is the default document library in a user's in SharePoint Server or in Microsoft 365. The contents of this library can optionally be synchronized with one or more of the user's computers or devices.   
By using OneDrive, you can help ensure that business files for your users are stored in a central location. Storing business files in one location makes it easy for users to share and collaborate on documents. If you're using OneDrive, you can also reduce your on-premises storage costs by moving your users' files to the cloud.  
OneDrive is different from the consumer OneDrive service in that OneDrive is based on SharePoint and is meant for storing a user's business documents and files. Consumer OneDrive is a separate service that is meant for personal use.

Users can upload, download, and interact with OneDrive files from a web browser, but the ideal OneDrive experience comes from the Windows and Mac sync apps and the iOS and Android mobile apps. With these clients and apps, saving files to OneDrive and interacting with them is easier than visiting a website each time you need something. Through this experience, you can seamlessly integrate OneDrive into your existing file interaction experiences.
For information about planning and deploying the sync app for your organization, see [Plan file sync for SharePoint and OneDrive in Microsoft 365](plan-file-sync.md).

In SharePoint Server, OneDrive is simply the document library in a user's MySite. This provides personal storage for your users, either directly through the document library in their My Site, or as a save location in Office 2013 or Office 2016. While OneDrive files are saved to the cloud, in OneDrive in a SharePoint Server on-premises environment, user files are stored in the SharePoint Content database in the SQL Server that you are using for SharePoint Server. User storage quotas are set through site settings for the web application that is hosting the My Site host site.

**What are the license requirements?**
Your organization needs to have the right license and meet certain administrative permissions or roles to use the feature described in this article.
First, your organization must have one of the following base licenses:
- Office 365 E3, E5, or A5
- Microsoft 365 E1, E3, E5, or A5
Additionally, you need at least one of these licenses:
- **Microsoft 365 Copilot license:** At least one user in your organization must be assigned a Copilot license (this user doesn't need to be a SharePoint administrator).
- **Microsoft SharePoint Advanced Management license:** Available as a standalone purchase.
**Administrator requirements**
You must be a [SharePoint administrator](/sharepoint/sharepoint-admin-role) or have equivalent permissions.
**Additional information**
If your organization has a Copilot license and at least one person in your organization is assigned a Copilot license, SharePoint administrators automatically gain access to the [SharePoint Advanced Management features needed for Copilot deployment](/sharepoint/sharepoint-advanced-management-licensing#sharepoint-advanced-management-features-in-microsoft-365-copilot-licenses).
For organizations without a Copilot license, you can use SharePoint Advanced Management features [by purchasing a standalone SharePoint Advanced Management license](/sharepoint/advanced-management#licensing).

--- [Chunk 2 | Source: advanced-management.md] ---
Before you get started, make sure SharePoint Advanced Management (SAM) features are available to your organizations through one of the following two licensing options:
- If your organization has a Copilot license and at least one user is assigned a Copilot license, SharePoint administrators automatically gain access to the SharePoint Advanced Management features required for Copilot deployment. The only SAM feature not included with Copilot is [Restricted Site Creation](restricted-site-creation.md).
- Organizations without a Copilot license can access SharePoint Advanced Management features by [purchasing a standalone SharePoint Advanced Management license](/sharepoint/advanced-management#licensing).
SAM features are managed by [IT administrators](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles) with access to the [SharePoint admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185219). Some features can also be used by site owners.

SharePoint Advanced Management uses a per-user licensing model. You can purchase a standalone SharePoint Advanced Management license for each user in your organization. External users don't require this license.
If your organization has a Microsoft 365 Copilot license and at least one user is assigned to a Copilot license, SharePoint administrators automatically receive access to the [SharePoint Advanced Management features required for Copilot deployment](/sharepoint/sharepoint-advanced-management-licensing#sharepoint-advanced-management-features-in-microsoft-365-copilot-licenses).

In addition, to use Restricted site creation for apps, you need to: 
- Download and install the [latest version](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=35588) of Microsoft SharePoint Online Management Shell.  
- Make sure you can configure apps that are allowed to create SharePoint sites.

--- [Chunk 4 | Source: restricted-site-creation.md] ---
The restricted site creation feature lets IT administrators use [SharePoint Online Management Shell](/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/introduction-sharepoint-online-management-shell#getting-started-with-sharepoint-online-powershell) to designate which Microsoft Entra security groups in their tenant can create OneDrive and SharePoint sites.
You can choose between two ways to manage site creation within your tenant: deny mode (the specified groups are unable to create sites) and allow mode (only the specified groups are allowed to create sites). Once you enable this feature for your tenant, restricted site creation is set to deny mode by default. 
Restricted site creation policies only control site provisioning capabilities and not site access permissions.

- **[Restricted Access Control (RAC)](/sharepoint/restricted-access-control)**: Restrict access to:

--- [Chunk 3 | Source: create-sharepoint-site-ownership-policy.md] ---
Before running the site ownership policy, it's important to resolve any user ID mismatches to ensure accurate ownership outcomes for each site. Sometimes, if a site owner was deleted and later recreated, ownership references may point to an old, non-existent PUID. As a tenant admin, you should fix these mismatches by running the [Site User ID Mismatch diagnostic](/troubleshoot/sharepoint/sharing-and-permissions/fix-site-user-id-mismatch).

--- [Chunk 4 | Source: advanced-management.md] ---
**[Site ownership policies](create-sharepoint-site-ownership-policy.md)** are a part of site lifecycle management. These policies help you automatically monitor and enforce site ownership requirements across your organization. You can create these policies to define who should be responsible for each site, set minimum owner or admin counts, and automate notifications when sites don't meet your criteria. By regularly identifying noncompliant sites and prompting users to take action, site ownership policies support effective site management, reduce the risk of ownerless sites, and help maintain security and compliance in your SharePoint environment.

--- [Chunk 5 | Source: create-sharepoint-site-ownership-policy.md] ---
Different organizations have different needs. Site ownership policies allow you to customize how ownership is determined by allowing you to:
- Choose who is considered responsible for managing a site in your organization - site owners or site admins or both.  
- Define the minimum number of owners or admins a site should have, currently up to 2.

Why do Anyone links not make files searchable or accessible via Copilot until the link is redeemed?,5.0,"The context is highly relevant to the query, providing a clear explanation of why ""Anyone"" links do not make files searchable or accessible until redeemed.

*Anyone* link access to files that contain sensitive information.
***People in your organization* links**
*People in your organization* links are a great way to share information within your organization. *People in your organization* links work for anyone in your organization, so users can share files and folders with people who aren't part of a team or members of a site. The link when redeemed, gives access to the particular file or folder and can be passed around inside the organization. This allows for easy collaboration with stakeholders from groups that may have separate teams or sites – such as design, marketing, and support groups.
Creating a *People in your organization* link won't make the associated file or folder appear in search results, be accessible via Copilot, or grant access to everyone within the organization. Simply creating this link doesn't provide organizational-wide access to the content. For individuals to access the file or folder, they must possess the link and it needs to be activated through redemption. A user can redeem the link by clicking on it, or in some instances, the link may be automatically redeemed when sent to someone via email, chat, or other communication methods. The link doesn't work for guests or other people outside your organization.
***Specific people* links**
*Specific people* links are best for circumstances where users want to limit access to a file or folder. The link only works for the person specified and they must authenticate in order to use it. These links can be internal or external (if you've enabled guest sharing).

  Like an *anyone* link, a *people in my organization* link is a transferrable, revocable secret key. Unlike an *anyone* link, these links only work for people inside your Microsoft 365 organization. When somebody opens a *people in my organization* link, they need to be authenticated as a member in your directory. If they're not currently signed-in, they're prompted to sign in. 
  Similar to an *anyone* link, creating a *People in your organization* link doesn't make the associated file or folder appear in search results, be accessible via Copilot, or grant access to everyone within the organization. Simply creating this link doesn't provide organizational-wide access to the content. For individuals to access the file or folder, they must possess the link and it needs to be activated through redemption. A user can redeem the link by selecting it. Also, if the link is sent from the SharePoint or OneDrive Web UI, or as email in Outlook or chat message in Teams, it will be automatically redeemed for individual recipients, up to a limit of 100. This feature is not supported for group recipients, or for messages posted in Teams channels. The link doesn't work for guests or other people outside your organization.  
- *Specific people* links only work for the people that users specify when they share the item.  
  ![Diagram showing how specific people links only work for the people specified.](media/DMC_SharePointSharingLinks_Specific.png)
  A *specific people* link is a nontransferable, revocable secret key. Unlike *anyone* and *people in my organization* links, *specific people* links don't work if they're opened by anybody other than the person specified by the sender.

--- [Chunk 3 | Source: shareable-links-anyone-specific-people-organization.md] ---
When users share files and folders in Microsoft 365, a shareable link is created which has permissions to the item. There are three primary link types:
- *Anyone* links give access to the item to anyone who has the link. People using an *Anyone* link don't have to authenticate, and their access can't be audited.
  ![Diagram showing how anyone links can be passed from user to user.](media/DMC_SharePointSharingLinks_Anyone.png)      
  An *anyone* link is a transferrable, revocable secret key. It's transferrable because it can be forwarded to others. It's revocable because by deleting the link, you can revoke the access of everyone who got it through the link. It's secret because it can't be guessed or derived. The only way to get access is to get the link, and the only way to get the link is for somebody to give it to you. *Anyone* links can't be used with files in a Teams shared channel site.
    Simply creating an *anyone* link doesn't make the associated content appear in search results, be accessible via Copilot, or immediately grant access to the content to everyone. An *anyone* link must be activated by clicking the link (redemption) before the shared content becomes searchable by the person in possession of the link.
- *People in your organization* links work for only people inside your Microsoft 365 organization. (They don't work for guests in the directory, only members).

  A *specific people* link is a nontransferable, revocable secret key. Unlike *anyone* and *people in my organization* links, *specific people* links don't work if they're opened by anybody other than the person specified by the sender. In addition, unlike *anyone* or *people in my organization* links, *specific people* links makes the associated file or folder appear in search results and is accessible via Copilot for all user and security group members added to the sharing link.    
  *Specific people* links can be used to share with users in the organization and people outside the organization. In both cases, the recipient needs to authenticate as the user specified in the link. For files in a Teams shared channel site, *specific people* links can only be sent to others in the channel.
It's important to educate your users in how these sharing links work and which they should use to best maintain the security of your data. Send your users links to [Share OneDrive files and folders](https://support.office.com/article/9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07) and [Share SharePoint files or folders](https://support.office.com/article/1fe37332-0f9a-4719-970e-d2578da4941c), and include information about your organization's policies for sharing information.

Restricted SharePoint Search gives you time to review and audit site permissions. We provide Restricted SharePoint Search to help you maintain momentum with your Copilot deployment while you're implementing comprehensive data security with [SharePoint Advanced Management](/sharepoint/advanced-management), and [Microsoft Purview](/purview/ai-microsoft-purview). Combined, these solutions offer a complete solution for data discovery, protection, and governance, ensuring a secure and managed data lifecycle.
Restricted SharePoint Search addresses oversharing concerns by allowing organizations to:
- Prevent sites from showing up in organization-wide search results and Copilot experiences until your admins or site owners can check the permissions on the site content;
- Honor existing site permissions, and let site owners manage individual site permissions.
If Restricted SharePoint Search is enabled, the customer's experience is impacted in the following ways:
- Search results are limited to sites on the allowed list, users’ frequently visited sites, sites that users already have permissions to, and users’ recently accessed files.  Turning on this feature impacts the overall search experience, even for non-Copilot users.
- Copilot has less information available to reference, which may impact its ability to provide accurate and comprehensive responses.
Remember, whether you have enabled Restricted SharePoint Search, users in your organization are always able to interact with files and content they own or that they have previously accessed in Copilot    .","[{""search_score"": 0.03253968432545662, ""reranker_score"": 2.8854639530181885, ""id"": ""845f2af64944_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9kZXBsb3ktZmlsZS1jb2xsYWJvcmF0aW9uLm1kOzk1_pages_2"", ""title"": ""deploy-file-collaboration.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.032522473484277725, ""reranker_score"": 2.7139008045196533, ""id"": ""7dfcc886b686_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9zaGFyZWFibGUtbGlua3MtYW55b25lLXNwZWNpZmljLXBlb3BsZS1vcmdhbml6YXRpb24ubWQ7Mg2_pages_1"", ""title"": ""shareable-links-anyone-specific-people-organization.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.03306011110544205, ""reranker_score"": 2.6848344802856445, ""id"": ""7dfcc886b686_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9zaGFyZWFibGUtbGlua3MtYW55b25lLXNwZWNpZmljLXBlb3BsZS1vcmdhbml6YXRpb24ubWQ7Mg2_pages_0"", ""title"": ""shareable-links-anyone-specific-people-organization.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.031054403632879257, ""reranker_score"": 2.4425547122955322, ""id"": ""7dfcc886b686_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9zaGFyZWFibGUtbGlua3MtYW55b25lLXNwZWNpZmljLXBlb3BsZS1vcmdhbml6YXRpb24ubWQ7Mg2_pages_2"", ""title"": ""shareable-links-anyone-specific-people-organization.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.022627200931310654, ""reranker_score"": 2.3748512268066406, ""id"": ""a59b7f647b58_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9yZXN0cmljdGVkLXNoYXJlcG9pbnQtc2VhcmNoLm1kOzQ1_pages_0"", ""title"": ""restricted-sharepoint-search.md""}]"

- **Azure Data Box**. Want to remove the dependency on your WAN link to transfer data? The Microsoft Azure Data Box is a service that lets you order a device from the Microsoft Azure portal. You can then copy terabytes of data from your servers to the device, ship it back to Microsoft, and your data is copied into Azure. Once your data's in Azure, use SPMT to migrate content to SharePoint. To learn more, see [Migrate using the Azure Data Box](how-to-migrate-file-share-content-to-SPO-using-AzureDataBox.md).
- **OneDrive sync app** To migrate users' Windows known folders (Desktop, Documents, Pictures, Screenshots, and Camera Roll) to OneDrive, you can use [Known Folder Move](/onedrive/redirect-known-folders). If users want to move other files from their local computer or a network file share to OneDrive or SharePoint, it's often easiest for them to use the OneDrive sync app. Users drag their files or folders to a folder they're syncing.

Conditional access control capabilities in Microsoft Entra ID offer simple ways for you to secure resources in the cloud. The new OneDrive sync app works with the conditional access control policies to ensure syncing is only done with compliant devices. For example, you might require sync to be available only on domain-joined devices or devices that meet compliance as defined by the Mobile Device Management system (like Intune).  
For information about how conditional access works, see:  
- [Microsoft Entra Conditional Access](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/)

With at least the permissions of a [SharePoint Administrator](./sharepoint-admin-role.md) in Microsoft 365, you can block or limit access to SharePoint and OneDrive content from unmanaged devices (those not [hybrid AD joined](/azure/active-directory/devices/overview#hybrid-azure-ad-joined-devices) or compliant in Intune). You can block or limit access for:
- All users in the organization or only some users or security groups.
- All sites in the organization or only some sites.
Blocking access helps provide security but comes at the cost of usability and productivity. When access is blocked, users see the following error.
![The experience when access is blocked](media/unmanaged-device-access-blocked.png)
Limiting access allows users to remain productive while addressing the risk of accidental data loss on unmanaged devices. When you limit access, users on managed devices have full access (unless they use one of the browser and operating system combinations listed in [Supported browsers](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-conditions#supported-browsers)). Users on unmanaged devices have browser-only access with no ability to download, print, or sync files. They also won't be able to access content through apps, including the Microsoft Office desktop apps. When you limit access, you can choose to allow or block editing files in the browser. When web access is limited, users see the following message at the top of sites.

To allow custom script on a particular site (previously called _site collection_) immediately, follow these steps:
1. [Download the latest SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=255251).
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you installed a previous version of the SharePoint Online Management Shell, go to Add or remove programs and uninstall **SharePoint Online Management Shell**.
2. Connect to SharePoint as a [SharePoint Administrator](./sharepoint-admin-role.md) in Microsoft 365. To learn how, see [Getting started with SharePoint Online Management Shell](/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online).
3. Run the following command.
    ```PowerShell
    Set-SPOSite <SiteURL> -DenyAddAndCustomizePages 0
    ```
    or with the PnP.PowerShell cmdlet [Set-PnPSite](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/cmdlets/Set-PnPSite.html)    
    ```PowerShell
    Set-PnPSite -Identity <SiteURL> -NoScriptSite $false

As a [SharePoint Administrator](./sharepoint-admin-role.md) in Microsoft 365, you can temporarily allow custom script as a way of letting users operate with some ""classic"" features (like ""script editor web part""), change the look, feel, and behavior of sites and pages to meet organizational objectives or individual needs. If you allow custom script, all users who have _Add and Customize Pages_ permission to a site or page can add any script they want. (By default, users who create sites are site owners and therefore have this permission.)   
> [!NOTE]
> For simple ways to change the look and feel of a site, see [Change the look of your SharePoint site](https://support.office.com/article/06bbadc3-6b04-4a60-9d14-894f6a170818).   
By default, script isn't allowed on almost all sites that admins create using the SharePoint admin center and all sites created using the New-SPOSite PowerShell command. Same applies to OneDrive, sites users create themselves, modern team and communication sites, and the root site for your organization. For more info about the security implications of custom script, see [Security considerations of allowing custom script](security-considerations-of-allowing-custom-script.md).  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If SharePoint was set up for your organization before 2015, your custom script settings might still be set to _Not Configured_ even though in the SharePoint admin center they appear to be set to prevent users from running custom script.

The sharing settings that you configure for SharePoint and OneDrive determine who your users can collaborate with, both inside and outside your organization. Depending on your business needs and the sensitivity of your data, you can:
- Disallow sharing with people outside your organization.
- Require people outside your organization to authenticate.
- Restrict sharing to specified domains.
You can configure these settings for the entire organization, or for each site independently (except private or shared channel sites). For detailed information, see [Turn sharing on or off](turn-external-sharing-on-or-off.md) and [Turn sharing on or off for a site](change-external-sharing-site.md).
See [Limit accidental exposure to files when sharing with guests](/microsoft-365/solutions/share-limit-accidental-exposure) for more guidance around sharing with people outside your organization.
When users share files and folders, a shareable link is created which has permissions to the item. There are three primary link types:
- *Anyone* - links that work for anyone and don't require sign-in
- *People in your organization* - links that work for users in your organization
- *Specific people* - links that work for the people specified when the link is created
For more information about these link types, see [How shareable links work in OneDrive and SharePoint in Microsoft 365](shareable-links-anyone-specific-people-organization.md).
**Unauthenticated access with *Anyone* links**
*Anyone* links are a great way to easily share files and folders with people outside your organization. However, if you're sharing sensitive information, this may not be the best option.
If you require people outside your organization to authenticate, *Anyone* links won't be available to users and you're able to audit guest activity on shared files and folders.

--- [Chunk 2 | Source: collaboration-options.md] ---
The organization level sharing settings for SharePoint and OneDrive provide a default setting for sites and OneDrive libraries. Individual sites can be locked down further, but cannot be made more permissive than, the organizational settings.
A key decision for your SharePoint and OneDrive rollout is who content can be shared with:
- **Anyone** - Users can share files and folders using links that don't require sign-in.
- **New and existing guests** - Guests are added to the directory when an item is shared and must sign in or provide a verification code to access the content.
- **Existing guests** - Users can only share with guests already in your organization's directory. (This setting is not recommended because guests can be added to the directory in various ways outside of SharePoint and OneDrive.)
- **Only people in your organization** - No external sharing is allowed.
These settings can be set separately for SharePoint and OneDrive, though the OneDrive setting cannot be more permissive than the SharePoint setting.
Important decisions:
- Do you want to allow external sharing? If not, choose the **Only people in your organization** option.
- Do you want to allow users to create sharing links that allow unauthenticated (anonymous) people to access files or folders? If so, choose **Anyone**.

**Unauthenticated access with *Anyone* links**
*Anyone* links are a great way to easily share files and folders with people outside your organization. However, if you're sharing sensitive information, this may not be the best option.
If you require people outside your organization to authenticate, *Anyone* links won't be available to users and you're able to audit guest activity on shared files and folders.
Though *Anyone* links don't require people outside your organization to authenticate, you can track the usage of *Anyone* links and revoke access if needed.
If you want to allow *Anyone* links, there are several options for a more secure sharing experience.
You can restrict *Anyone* links to read-only. You can also set an expiration time limit, after which the link stops working.
Another option is to configure a different link type to be displayed to the user by default. This can help minimize the chances of inappropriate sharing. For example, if you want to allow *Anyone* links but are concerned that they only be used for specific purposes, you can [set the default link type](change-default-sharing-link.md) to *Specific people* links or *People in your organization* links instead of *Anyone* links. Users would then have to explicitly select *Anyone* links when they share a file or folder.
You can also use data loss prevention to restrict *Anyone* link access to files that contain sensitive information.
***People in your organization* links**
*People in your organization* links are a great way to share information within your organization. *People in your organization* links work for anyone in your organization, so users can share files and folders with people who aren't part of a team or members of a site. The link when redeemed, gives access to the particular file or folder and can be passed around inside the organization.

--- [Chunk 4 | Source: external-sharing-overview.md] ---
SharePoint has external sharing settings at both the organization level and the site level (previously called the ""site collection"" level). To allow external sharing on any site, you must allow it at the organization level. You can then restrict external sharing for other sites. If a site's external sharing option and the organization-level sharing option don't match, the most restrictive value will always be applied. OneDrive sharing settings can be the same as or more restrictive than the SharePoint settings.  
Whichever option you choose at the organization or site level, the more restrictive functionality is still available. For example, if you choose to allow unauthenticated sharing using ""Anyone"" links, users can still share with guests, who sign in, and with internal users. 
> [!NOTE]
> Even if your organization-level setting allows external sharing, not all new sites allow it by default. See [Default site sharing settings](/microsoft-365/solutions/microsoft-365-guest-settings#default-site-sharing-settings) for more information.
**Security and privacy**  
If you have confidential information that should never be shared externally, we recommend storing the information in a site that has external sharing turned off. Create additional sites as needed to use for external sharing. This helps you to manage security risk by preventing external access to sensitive information.
> [!NOTE]
> To limit *internal* sharing of contents on a site, you can prevent site members from sharing, and enable access requests. For info, see [Set up and manage access requests](https://support.office.com/article/94B26E0B-2822-49D4-929A-8455698654B3).

> When users share a folder with multiple guests, the guests are able to see each other's names in the Manage Access panel for the folder (and any items within it).

To create an easy sharing experience for your users while reducing the risk of oversharing, you can choose from these options for file and folder sharing links:
- Choose the default link type that users see when they share a file or folder.
- Choose if the default sharing link allows recipients to edit the files.
- Choose if *Anyone* links expire after a given period.
- Choose if *Anyone* links allow recipients to edit the files.
When users share a file or folder, they can choose from several types of sharing links that offer different levels of permissions. You can choose which link type is shown by default:
- *Specific people* links require the user to specify a list of people who will have access to the file or folder.
- *Only people in your organization* links provide access to the file or folder to anyone in your organization who has the link.
- *Anyone* links (if you've enabled them in your organization level sharing settings) provide anonymous access to anyone who has the link, including people outside your organization.
You can also choose the default permission level - view or edit - for sharing links.
These options can also be configured for individual sites. See [Change the sharing settings for a site](/sharepoint/change-external-sharing-site) for details.
If you've enabled *Anyone* links, you can choose if these links should expire after a given period and if they should allow edit access or just view access.","[{""search_score"": 0.01874658092856407, ""reranker_score"": 2.75289249420166, ""id"": ""845f2af64944_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9kZXBsb3ktZmlsZS1jb2xsYWJvcmF0aW9uLm1kOzk1_pages_0"", ""title"": ""deploy-file-collaboration.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.018971849232912064, ""reranker_score"": 2.594799280166626, ""id"": ""88307f7b98b9_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9jb2xsYWJvcmF0aW9uLW9wdGlvbnMubWQ7NQ2_pages_0"", ""title"": ""collaboration-options.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.025138041004538536, ""reranker_score"": 2.558643341064453, ""id"": ""845f2af64944_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9kZXBsb3ktZmlsZS1jb2xsYWJvcmF0aW9uLm1kOzk1_pages_1"", ""title"": ""deploy-file-collaboration.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.018180400133132935, ""reranker_score"": 2.554389715194702, ""id"": ""350d01f734e8_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9leHRlcm5hbC1zaGFyaW5nLW92ZXJ2aWV3Lm1kOzQ1_pages_0"", ""title"": ""external-sharing-overview.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.01781585067510605, ""reranker_score"": 2.487572193145752, ""id"": ""88307f7b98b9_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9jb2xsYWJvcmF0aW9uLW9wdGlvbnMubWQ7Nw2_pages_0"", ""title"": ""collaboration-options.md""}]"

1. To use PowerShell: [Download the latest SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=255251).
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you installed a previous version of the SharePoint Online Management Shell, go to Add or remove programs and uninstall ""SharePoint Online Management Shell.""
2. Connect to SharePoint as a [SharePoint Administrator](./sharepoint-admin-role.md) in Microsoft 365. To learn how, see [Getting started with SharePoint Online Management Shell](/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online).
3. Run the following command.
    ```PowerShell
    Set-SPOSite -Identity <SiteURL> -BlockDownloadPolicy $true
    ```
    For example, `Set-SPOSite -Identity https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/research -BlockDownloadPolicy $true`. You can apply this cmdlet to OneDrive as well by changing the URL to `https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/personal/John`.
    The following parameters can be used with this cmdlet to fine-tune it:    
    - `-ExcludeBlockDownloadPolicySiteOwners $true`<br/>Exempts site owners from this policy and they can fully download any content for the site.    
    - `-ExcludedBlockDownloadGroupIds <comma separated group IDs>`<br/>Exempts users from the mentioned groups from this policy and they can fully download any content for the site.    
    - `-ExcludeBlockDownloadSharePointGroups <comma separated group names>`<br/>Exempts users from the mentioned SharePoint groups from this policy and they can fully download any content for the site.    
    - `-ReadOnlyForBlockDownloadPolicy $true`<br/>Marks the site as read-only in addition to preventing downloads.
You also can attach a block download policy to a site sensitivity label.  
```PowerShell
Set-Label -Identity 'Internal' -AdvancedSettings @{BlockDownloadPolicy=""true"" | “false” }
Set-Label -Identity 'Internal' -AdvancedSettings @{ExcludedBlockDownloadGroupIds=""<list of security or M365 groups>""}

For business-critical sites, you want to take proactive measures to ensure the content is appropriately shared, and access to content is limited to the minimum level. You can lock down your most important sites with the following measures:
- Use [Restricted Access Control (RAC)](/sharepoint/restricted-access-control) to proactively protect against oversharing. Even better: as part of your custom site provisioning process, configure RAC policy on new sites from the get-go and proactively avoid oversharing forever.
- Use [Restricted Content Discovery](/sharepoint/restricted-content-discovery) to leave permissions in place, but prevent the content from being available to Microsoft 365 Copilot and Organization-wide search experiences.
- Consider blocking downloads from selected sites via a block download policy. Or specifically [block the download of Teams meeting recordings and transcripts](/microsoftteams/block-download-meeting-recording).
- Finally, consider applying encryption action with ""extract rights"" enforced on business-critical office documents.

The external sharing features of SharePoint let users in your organization share content with people outside the organization (such as partners, vendors, clients, or customers). Planning for external sharing should be included as part of your overall permissions planning for SharePoint.
SharePoint has external sharing settings at both the organization level and the site level (previously called the ""site collection"" level). To allow external sharing on any site, you must allow it at the organization level. You can then restrict external sharing for other sites.

Whichever option you choose at the organization or site level, the more restrictive functionality is still available. For example, if you choose to allow sharing using *Anyone* links, users can still share with guests, who sign in, and with internal users.   
External sharing is turned on by default for your organization. Default settings for individual sites vary depending on the type of site. See [Site level settings](/microsoft-365/solutions/microsoft-365-guest-settings#default-site-sharing-settings) for more information.
[Shared channels in teams](/MicrosoftTeams/shared-channels) do not use guest accounts for sharing with people outside the organization. However, external sharing must be enabled for people outside the organization to be invited to shared channels.

#### Limit external sharing by domain
This is useful if you want to limit sharing with particular partners, or help prevent sharing with people at certain organizations. The organization-level setting on this page affects all SharePoint sites and each user's OneDrive. To use this setting, list the domains (maximum of 5000) in the box, using the format *domain.com*. To list multiple domains, press Enter after adding each domain. 
You can also limit external sharing by domain by using the [Set-SPOTenant](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/Set-SPOTenant) Microsoft PowerShell cmdlet with -SharingDomainRestrictionMode and either -SharingAllowedDomainList or -SharingBlockedDomainList. For info about limiting external sharing by domain at the site level, see [Restricted domains sharing](restricted-domains-sharing.md).
[Allowed or blocked domains in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/allow-deny-list) also affect SharePoint and OneDrive site sharing (always) and file and folder sharing (if Azure B2B collaboration is enabled). Be sure to review Microsoft Entra collaboration restrictions as part of your SharePoint and OneDrive sharing setup.
#### Allow only users in specific security groups to share externally
For info about this setting, see [Manage security groups](./manage-security-groups.md).
#### Allow guests to share items they don't own
By default, guests must have full control permission to share items externally.
#### Guest access to a site or OneDrive will expire automatically after this many days
If your administrator has set an expiration time for guest access, each guest that you invite to the site or with whom you share individual files and folders will be given access for a certain number of days. For more information visit, [Manage guest expiration for a site](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/manage-guest-expiration-for-a-site-25bee24f-42ad-4ee8-8402-4186eed74dea)

In order for users at your organization to be able to share with their partners at other organizations, external sharing must be enabled at the organization level. To do this, you must be a global or SharePoint admin in Microsoft 365. After you enable external sharing at the organization level, you can restrict it site by site. A site's settings can be the same as the organization setting, or more restrictive, but not more permissive.
You can change your organization-level sharing settings in two different places (both control the same thing):
- On the Sharing page in the new SharePoint admin center. For more info, see [Change the organization-level external sharing setting](/sharepoint/turn-external-sharing-on-or-off#change-the-organization-level-external-sharing-setting)
- In the Microsoft 365 admin center, on the Org settings page > SharePoint.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you allow Anyone links (sometimes referred to as ""anonymous access"" links), these links don't create guest accounts and therefore the external share recipient won't be able to use B2B Sync when receiving that link type.
For more info, see [External sharing overview](/sharepoint/external-sharing-overview).

EEEU is a built-in SharePoint group that automatically includes all internal users but excludes any external guests. The 'Everyone except external users' (EEEU) report is one of the two activity reports that helps you identify sites where content has been shared with your entire organization in the past 28 days. You can run the  [site permissions for your organization report](#what-is-the-site-permissions-for-your-organization-report) first to understand your organization's current EEEU sharing baseline, then use this activity report to monitor ongoing EEEU sharing activities.

Here's how:
**Report configure options:**
- **Report name**: Enter a unique name to identify this report
- **Template**: Select which SharePoint site templates to include (you can select multiple template types or choose ""All sites""):
    - Classic sites
    - Communication sites
    - Team sites
    - Others
    - All sites (to include everything)
- **Privacy**: For Team sites, filter by privacy setting:
    - Private
    - Public
    - All (both private and public)
- **Site sensitivity**: Choose specific sensitivity labels to focus on sites with particular security classifications. For example, you can identify files shared with EEEU within sites labeled as ""Confidential"" in the last 28 days
- **Report type**: Select which EEEU scenario to analyze:
    - **Public sites**: Sites where EEEU is part of the site membership
    - **Public items**: Individual files or folders shared with EEEU

Activity reports help you track potential oversharing activities that occurred in the last 28 days. These reports focus on ""recently active"" sites where users created sharing links or shared content with large groups. For all activities tracked in activity reports, you can find corresponding ""baseline"" data in the [snapshot reports](#what-are-snapshot-reports).
Currently, two types of activity reports are available to help you identify potential oversharing:
- **[Sharing links reports](#what-is-the-sharing-links-report)**: Identifies sites where users recently created the most sharing links (including ""Anyone,"" ""People in the organization,"" and ""Specific people"" links) to help you catch potential oversharing as it happens.
- **[Shared with 'Everyone except external users' reports](#what-is-the-everyone-except-external-users-eeeu-report)**: Tracks sites where content is shared with all internal users in your organization, helping you identify broad internal exposure that could lead to unintended data access.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **For organizations without SharePoint Advanced Management:**
> You must enable data collection before you can generate activity reports. Here's what you need to know:
>
> - After enabling data collection, the system starts collecting audit data

'Everyone except external users' (EEEU) is a built-in SharePoint group that automatically includes all internal users but excludes any external guests. The 'Everyone except external users' (EEEU) report is one of the two types of Data access governance activity reports available with [SharePoint Advanced Management](advanced-management.md). The EEEU activity reports help you identify sites where content is shared with your entire organization in the past 28 days. We recommend running the  [site permissions report](data-access-governance-site-permissions-report.md) first to understand your organization's current EEEU sharing baseline, then use the EEEU activity report to monitor ongoing EEEU sharing activities.

--- [Chunk 5 | Source: powershell-for-data-access-governance.md] ---
While Sharing links are one possible contributor for potential oversharing, another key contributor is 'Everyone except external users' (EEEU) which makes content 'public' that is, visible to entire organization and makes it easy for others to discover content and get access. These reports identify sites that actively used EEEU at various scopes in last 28 days.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't have a Microsoft SharePoint Advanced Management license, you are asked to enable data collection for 'RecentActivity' based reports, so that the product starts to collect the relevant audit data to build this report. Once enabled, the data is collected and stored for 28 days. The reports can be generated 24 hours later and contains data from the point of collection. If no reports are generated even once in three months, data collection is paused and should be enabled again. To enable data collection for these reports, refer to the [documentation in the section below](#data-collection-for-recent-activity-based-reports).
#### Sites shared with Everyone except external users in last 28 days
When EEEU is added to a site membership (owners, members, or visitors), the entire content of the site becomes public and more prone to oversharing. The following PowerShell command triggers the report to capture such sites in the last 28 days:
```powershell

In SharePoint, if you share with a person who isn't in the directory, they're sent a one-time code that they can use to verify their identity.
This article describes the current default one-time-passcode experience. However, we recommend that you enable [SharePoint and OneDrive integration with Microsoft Entra B2B](sharepoint-azureb2b-integration.md), which replaces this experience.
Recipients of secure external sharing who also use Microsoft 365 in their organization can sign in using their work or school account to access the document. After they enter the one-time passcode for verification the first time, they authenticate with their work or school account and have a guest account created in the host's organization. IT admins can manage them like any other guest account in their directory.
Guest accounts are used for sharing sites, and you can always add guests to your directory if you need to give them access to more than just a file or folder.
The following table shows the differences between sharing with people who have guest accounts and with ad hoc external recipients.
|&nbsp;|Guest account|Ad hoc external recipient|
|---|---|---|
|Can access shared files and folders|Yes|Yes|
|Verify access by...|Signing in to Microsoft 365|Entering a time-sensitive and single-use code sent to the email address that the file or folder was share with|
|Actions are audited|Yes|Yes|
|Can have friendly name|Yes|Friendly name is the email address that the file or folder was shared with|
|Can be Group members|Yes|No|
|Can edit in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or other Microsoft 365 apps|Yes|No|
|Access controlled by Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies|Yes|No|
 When you use the Share dialog box to share with ""specific people"" and the recipients are all outside the organization, then a secure link is created and the specified email addresses are secured, or added, to the link. This appears in audit logs in the following ways.

> After enabling Microsoft Entra B2B integration, external users attempting to access previously shared links (One Time Passcode) will encounter access issues. They receive error 'This organization has updated its guest access settings'. To restore access, your users need to reshare files/folders/sites to external users.
This article describes how to enable Microsoft SharePoint and Microsoft OneDrive integration with [Microsoft Entra B2B](/entra/external-id/what-is-b2b).
Microsoft Entra B2B provides authentication and management of guests. Authentication happens via one-time passcode when they don't already have a work or school account or a Microsoft account.
With SharePoint and OneDrive integrated with Azure B2B Invitation Manager, you can share files, folders, list items, document libraries, and sites with external people. This feature provides an upgraded experience from the existing secure external sharing recipient experience. Additionally, Azure B2B Invitation Manager offers a one-time passcode feature. This feature allows users without Work, School, or Microsoft accounts to authenticate using a code, instead of creating a new account.
Enabling this integration doesn't change your sharing settings. For example, if you have site collections where external sharing is turned off, it remains off.
SharePoint and OneDrive integration with the Microsoft Entra B2B one-time passcode feature is enabled by default for new tenants.
Advantages of Microsoft Entra B2B include:
- Invited people outside your organization are each given an account in the directory and are subject to Microsoft Entra ID access policies such as multifactor authentication.
- Invitations to a SharePoint site use Microsoft Entra B2B and no longer require users to have or create a Microsoft account.
- If you have Google federation in Microsoft Entra ID, federated users can now access SharePoint and OneDrive resources that you shared with them.

--- [Chunk 5 | Source: collaboration-options.md] ---
External sharing in SharePoint and OneDrive uses [Microsoft Entra B2B collaboration](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/what-is-b2b) to create guest accounts for people outside the organization. Guests can be given access to SharePoint sites or to individual files and folders in SharePoint and OneDrive.
External sharing is enabled by default in Microsoft 365, including SharePoint and OneDrive. We recommend leaving external sharing enabled. Microsoft 365 external sharing options can provide a more secure and governable sharing environment than sending attachments through email or using consumer sharing services.

The external sharing features of SharePoint let users in your organization share content with people outside the organization (such as partners, vendors, clients, or customers). Planning for external sharing should be included as part of your overall permissions planning for SharePoint.
SharePoint has external sharing settings at both the organization level and the site level (previously called the ""site collection"" level). To allow external sharing on any site, you must allow it at the organization level. You can then restrict external sharing for other sites. 
![External sharing settings in the SharePoint admin center](media/externalsharing.png)  
Whichever option you choose at the organization or site level, the more restrictive functionality is still available. For example, if you choose to allow sharing using *Anyone* links, users can still share with guests, who sign in, and with internal users.   
External sharing is turned on by default for your organization. Default settings for individual sites vary depending on the type of site. See [Site level settings](/microsoft-365/solutions/microsoft-365-guest-settings#default-site-sharing-settings) for more information.
[Shared channels in teams](/MicrosoftTeams/shared-channels) do not use guest accounts for sharing with people outside the organization. However, external sharing must be enabled for people outside the organization to be invited to shared channels.
To set up guest sharing for a site, see [Collaborate with guests in a site](/microsoft-365/solutions/collaborate-in-site).

SharePoint has external sharing settings at both the organization level and the site level (previously called the ""site collection"" level). To allow external sharing on any site, you must allow it at the organization level. You can then restrict external sharing for other sites. If a site's external sharing option and the organization-level sharing option don't match, the most restrictive value will always be applied. OneDrive sharing settings can be the same as or more restrictive than the SharePoint settings.  
Whichever option you choose at the organization or site level, the more restrictive functionality is still available. For example, if you choose to allow unauthenticated sharing using ""Anyone"" links, users can still share with guests, who sign in, and with internal users. 
> [!NOTE]
> Even if your organization-level setting allows external sharing, not all new sites allow it by default. See [Default site sharing settings](/microsoft-365/solutions/microsoft-365-guest-settings#default-site-sharing-settings) for more information.
**Security and privacy**  
If you have confidential information that should never be shared externally, we recommend storing the information in a site that has external sharing turned off. Create additional sites as needed to use for external sharing. This helps you to manage security risk by preventing external access to sensitive information.
> [!NOTE]
> To limit *internal* sharing of contents on a site, you can prevent site members from sharing, and enable access requests. For info, see [Set up and manage access requests](https://support.office.com/article/94B26E0B-2822-49D4-929A-8455698654B3).

| Select this option: | If you want to: |
|:-----|:-----|
|Anyone  | Allow site owners and others with full control permission to share the site with people who authenticate. Allow site users to decide when sharing files and folders to require authentication or allow unauthenticated people to access the item. Anyone links to files and folders can be freely forwarded. |
|New and existing guests  | Allow site owners and others with full control permission to share the site with people outside the organization. These people need to sign in and will be added to the directory. Allow site users to share files and folders with people who aren't in the organization's directory. |
|Existing guests  |Allow sharing with only people already in your directory. These users may exist in your directory because they previously accepted sharing invitations or because they were [manually added](/azure/active-directory/b2b/b2b-quickstart-add-guest-users-portal). (These users have **#EXT#** in their user principal name.)  |
|Only people in your organization  |Prevent all site users from sharing any site content externally.  |
The settings available are dependent on your organization-level setting. If you enable external sharing for a site and it's later turned off for your organization, external sharing becomes unavailable at the site level and any shared links stop working. If it's turned back on for the organization, the site sharing setting returns to what it was before and the shared links resume working.
> [!NOTE]
> You might have site content shared with a Microsoft 365 group that has guest members, and the group settings prevent guest members from accessing group resources. In this case, even if you turn on external sharing for the site, guests of the group may not be able to access site content. To enable or disable Microsoft 365 Group guest member access, see [Manage guest access in Microsoft 365 Groups](/microsoft-365/admin/create-groups/manage-guest-access-in-groups).

--- [Chunk 4 | Source: deploy-file-collaboration.md] ---
The sharing settings that you configure for SharePoint and OneDrive determine who your users can collaborate with, both inside and outside your organization. Depending on your business needs and the sensitivity of your data, you can:
- Disallow sharing with people outside your organization.
- Require people outside your organization to authenticate.
- Restrict sharing to specified domains.
You can configure these settings for the entire organization, or for each site independently (except private or shared channel sites). For detailed information, see [Turn sharing on or off](turn-external-sharing-on-or-off.md) and [Turn sharing on or off for a site](change-external-sharing-site.md).
See [Limit accidental exposure to files when sharing with guests](/microsoft-365/solutions/share-limit-accidental-exposure) for more guidance around sharing with people outside your organization.
When users share files and folders, a shareable link is created which has permissions to the item. There are three primary link types:
- *Anyone* - links that work for anyone and don't require sign-in
- *People in your organization* - links that work for users in your organization
- *Specific people* - links that work for the people specified when the link is created
For more information about these link types, see [How shareable links work in OneDrive and SharePoint in Microsoft 365](shareable-links-anyone-specific-people-organization.md).
**Unauthenticated access with *Anyone* links**
*Anyone* links are a great way to easily share files and folders with people outside your organization. However, if you're sharing sensitive information, this may not be the best option.
If you require people outside your organization to authenticate, *Anyone* links won't be available to users and you're able to audit guest activity on shared files and folders.

To minimize accidental content oversharing via Copilot results, it's crucial to implement the best practice sharing settings. Proactive safeguards are key. To effectively prepare your organization for Copilot, set the appropriate sharing settings for end users at both the organization and site levels:  
**At the organization level**:
- Update [sharing link defaults for your organization ](/sharepoint/turn-external-sharing-on-or-off#file-and-folder-links) for your organization from organization-wide sharing to specific people links.
- To reduce risks around accidental misuse, consider hiding broad-scope permissions from your end users. [This example](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant) hides ""Everyone Except External Users"" in the People Picker control so that no end user can use it.
**At the site level**:
Consider educating site admins on the site-level controls they can use to [restrict members from sharing](/powershell/module/microsoft.online.sharepoint.powershell/set-spotenant). One key setting here ensures that Site Owners are the recipients of [access requests](https://support.microsoft.com/office/set-up-and-manage-access-requests-94b26e0b-2822-49d4-929a-8455698654b3).","[{""search_score"": 0.03128054738044739, ""reranker_score"": 2.818114757537842, ""id"": ""9ec65fedad3a_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9tb2Rlcm4tZXhwZXJpZW5jZS1zaGFyaW5nLXBlcm1pc3Npb25zLm1kOzg1_pages_0"", ""title"": ""modern-experience-sharing-permissions.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.03279569745063782, ""reranker_score"": 2.6848344802856445, ""id"": ""350d01f734e8_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9leHRlcm5hbC1zaGFyaW5nLW92ZXJ2aWV3Lm1kOzQ1_pages_0"", ""title"": ""external-sharing-overview.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.0317460335791111, ""reranker_score"": 2.6727824211120605, ""id"": ""40b4304d42e5_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9jaGFuZ2UtZXh0ZXJuYWwtc2hhcmluZy1zaXRlLm1kOzM1_pages_0"", ""title"": ""change-external-sharing-site.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.023258818313479424, ""reranker_score"": 2.592672348022461, ""id"": ""845f2af64944_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9kZXBsb3ktZmlsZS1jb2xsYWJvcmF0aW9uLm1kOzk1_pages_0"", ""title"": ""deploy-file-collaboration.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.01690373197197914, ""reranker_score"": 2.5304629802703857, ""id"": ""350d01f734e8_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9nZXQtcmVhZHktY29waWxvdC1zaGFyZXBvaW50LWFkdmFuY2VkLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQubWQ7NA2_pages_0"", ""title"": ""get-ready-copilot-sharepoint-advanced-management.md""}]"

When you [change a SharePoint site address](change-site-address.md), such as [moving a site to a different geo location](/office365/enterprise/move-sharepoint-between-geo-locations), or [swapping a site](modern-root-site.md#replace-your-root-site), we automatically create redirects to ensure that prior URLs continue to work. These redirects are sites that use a special site template at the prior site URL.
For example, if you changed a site address from https://<i></i>contoso.sharepoint.<i></i>com/sites/*OldSiteName* to https://<i></i>contoso.sharepoint.<i></i>com/sites/*NewSiteName*, or if you moved a site from https://<i></i>*contoso*.sharepoint.<i></i>com/sites/SiteName to https://<i></i>*contosoEUR*.sharepoint.<i></i>com/sites/SiteName, we place a redirect (Template type REDIRECTSITE#0) at the old URL. This redirect contains special headers and logic to redirect your browser requests to the new site.
In some cases, you might want to free up the old URL to use it for a new site. To free up the old URL, you need to delete the redirect.
> [!NOTE]
> After you delete a redirect, any request to that URL won't get redirected. This means that any bookmarks, links, or Shared With Me references aren't routed to the new URL.

If you want to rename an organization with over 10,000 total sites or want to have greater control over the rename operation, you must use Advanced Tenant Rename. It supports changing the SharePoint domain on tenants with any number of sites and has the ability for admins to prioritize up to 4,000 sites in their organization for early execution within the overall rename. This allows for select business-critical or high-visibility sites to complete first and reduce any risk or concerns with its impact on daily operations.

As at least a [SharePoint Administrator](./sharepoint-admin-role.md) in your organization, you can change the URL for the following types of SharePoint sites (previously called ""site collections""):
- Microsoft 365 group-connected team sites
- Modern team sites that don't belong to a Microsoft 365 group
- Communication sites
- Classic team sites
Changing the site address isn't supported in the following situations:
- The Publishing feature is currently activated or was previously activated for the site.
- The site contains more than 15 million documents.
You can change only the address of the site within the URL, for example:
https://<i></i>contoso.sharepoint.<i></i>com/sites/*project-x*  
to
https://<i></i>contoso.sharepoint.<i></i>com/sites/*project-y*
You can't move the site from ""/sites"" to ""/teams."" For info about changing your SharePoint domain name, see [Change your SharePoint domain name](change-your-sharepoint-domain-name.md).
It can take about 10 minutes to change the site address (depending on the size of the site), and the site is read-only during this time. We recommend changing addresses during times when site usage is low.
You can change the address of up to 100 sites at a time. To change another site address, wait for ongoing changes to finish.

--- [Chunk 3 | Source: change-site-address.md] ---
If you need to change the address of a site that was previously changed, we recommend not renaming the site again. This can cause issues if you later want to use the current address for another site. Instead, we recommend returning the site back to its original address. To do so, you use an additional site rename and delete certain redirect sites. [Learn how to delete redirect sites](manage-site-redirects.md).
For a case where you changed https://<i></i>contoso.sharepoint.<i></i>com/sites/*project-x* to https://<i></i>contoso.sharepoint.<i></i>com/sites/*project-y* and want to revert back, the steps to follow are:
1. Delete the redirect from *project-x* to *project-y* by using the [Remove-SPOSite cmdlet](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/remove-sposite) on the *project-x* address.
2. Initiate a new site address change from *project-y* to *project-x*.
3. Delete the redirect from *project-y* to *project-x* by using the [Remove-SPOSite cmdlet](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/remove-sposite) on the *project-y* address.
   After following these steps, you should be back to the original state before the site address change.

--- [Chunk 4 | Source: manage-site-redirects.md] ---
When you [change a SharePoint site address](change-site-address.md), such as [moving a site to a different geo location](/office365/enterprise/move-sharepoint-between-geo-locations), or [swapping a site](modern-root-site.md#replace-your-root-site), we automatically create redirects to ensure that prior URLs continue to work. These redirects are sites that use a special site template at the prior site URL.
For example, if you changed a site address from https://<i></i>contoso.sharepoint.<i></i>com/sites/*OldSiteName* to https://<i></i>contoso.sharepoint.<i></i>com/sites/*NewSiteName*, or if you moved a site from https://<i></i>*contoso*.sharepoint.<i></i>com/sites/SiteName to https://<i></i>*contosoEUR*.sharepoint.<i></i>com/sites/SiteName, we place a redirect (Template type REDIRECTSITE#0) at the old URL. This redirect contains special headers and logic to redirect your browser requests to the new site.
In some cases, you might want to free up the old URL to use it for a new site. To free up the old URL, you need to delete the redirect.
> [!NOTE]
> After you delete a redirect, any request to that URL won't get redirected. This means that any bookmarks, links, or Shared With Me references aren't routed to the new URL.

When you first signed up for Microsoft 365, you created an onmicrosoft.com domain. Even if you later added a custom domain, the original onmicrosoft.com domain is used for all your SharePoint and OneDrive URLs. 
If your organization is going through a rebranding, merger, or acquisition and needs to change the domain in your SharePoint and OneDrive URLs, you can change the domain name using PowerShell. For example, if your organization name changed from Contoso to Fabrikam, you can change your SharePoint URLs from `contoso.sharepoint.com` to `fabrikam.sharepoint.com`.

As at least a [SharePoint Administrator](./sharepoint-admin-role.md) in your organization, you can change the URL for the following types of SharePoint sites (previously called ""site collections""):
- Microsoft 365 group-connected team sites
- Modern team sites that don't belong to a Microsoft 365 group
- Communication sites
- Classic team sites
Changing the site address isn't supported in the following situations:
- The Publishing feature is currently activated or was previously activated for the site.
- The site contains more than 15 million documents.
You can change only the address of the site within the URL, for example:
https://<i></i>contoso.sharepoint.<i></i>com/sites/*project-x*  
to
https://<i></i>contoso.sharepoint.<i></i>com/sites/*project-y*
You can't move the site from ""/sites"" to ""/teams."" For info about changing your SharePoint domain name, see [Change your SharePoint domain name](change-your-sharepoint-domain-name.md).
It can take about 10 minutes to change the site address (depending on the size of the site), and the site is read-only during this time. We recommend changing addresses during times when site usage is low.
You can change the address of up to 100 sites at a time. To change another site address, wait for ongoing changes to finish.
> [!NOTE]
> If you need to revert a site address change, follow the steps in [Revert a site address change](#revert-a-site-address-change).

Users can share files and folders in Microsoft SharePoint by sending a link. They should select a link type based on the people to whom they want to give permission. The following link types are available: 
- Anyone with the link (previously called ""anonymous access"" or ""shareable"")
- People in your organization with the link 
- People with existing access
- Specific people

**Unauthenticated access with *Anyone* links**
*Anyone* links are a great way to easily share files and folders with people outside your organization. However, if you're sharing sensitive information, this may not be the best option.
If you require people outside your organization to authenticate, *Anyone* links won't be available to users and you're able to audit guest activity on shared files and folders.
Though *Anyone* links don't require people outside your organization to authenticate, you can track the usage of *Anyone* links and revoke access if needed.
If you want to allow *Anyone* links, there are several options for a more secure sharing experience.
You can restrict *Anyone* links to read-only. You can also set an expiration time limit, after which the link stops working.
Another option is to configure a different link type to be displayed to the user by default. This can help minimize the chances of inappropriate sharing. For example, if you want to allow *Anyone* links but are concerned that they only be used for specific purposes, you can [set the default link type](change-default-sharing-link.md) to *Specific people* links or *People in your organization* links instead of *Anyone* links. Users would then have to explicitly select *Anyone* links when they share a file or folder.
You can also use data loss prevention to restrict *Anyone* link access to files that contain sensitive information.
***People in your organization* links**
*People in your organization* links are a great way to share information within your organization. *People in your organization* links work for anyone in your organization, so users can share files and folders with people who aren't part of a team or members of a site. The link when redeemed, gives access to the particular file or folder and can be passed around inside the organization.

The organization level sharing settings for SharePoint and OneDrive provide a default setting for sites and OneDrive libraries. Individual sites can be locked down further, but cannot be made more permissive than, the organizational settings.
A key decision for your SharePoint and OneDrive rollout is who content can be shared with:
- **Anyone** - Users can share files and folders using links that don't require sign-in.
- **New and existing guests** - Guests are added to the directory when an item is shared and must sign in or provide a verification code to access the content.
- **Existing guests** - Users can only share with guests already in your organization's directory. (This setting is not recommended because guests can be added to the directory in various ways outside of SharePoint and OneDrive.)
- **Only people in your organization** - No external sharing is allowed.
These settings can be set separately for SharePoint and OneDrive, though the OneDrive setting cannot be more permissive than the SharePoint setting.
Important decisions:
- Do you want to allow external sharing? If not, choose the **Only people in your organization** option.
- Do you want to allow users to create sharing links that allow unauthenticated (anonymous) people to access files or folders? If so, choose **Anyone**.

--- [Chunk 5 | Source: modern-experience-sharing-permissions.md] ---
The external sharing features of SharePoint let users in your organization share content with people outside the organization (such as partners, vendors, clients, or customers). Planning for external sharing should be included as part of your overall permissions planning for SharePoint.
SharePoint has external sharing settings at both the organization level and the site level (previously called the ""site collection"" level). To allow external sharing on any site, you must allow it at the organization level. You can then restrict external sharing for other sites. 
![External sharing settings in the SharePoint admin center](media/externalsharing.png)  
Whichever option you choose at the organization or site level, the more restrictive functionality is still available. For example, if you choose to allow sharing using *Anyone* links, users can still share with guests, who sign in, and with internal users.

With at least the permissions of a [SharePoint Administrator](./sharepoint-admin-role.md) in Microsoft 365, you can block or limit access to SharePoint and OneDrive content from unmanaged devices (those not [hybrid AD joined](/azure/active-directory/devices/overview#hybrid-azure-ad-joined-devices) or compliant in Intune). You can block or limit access for:
- All users in the organization or only some users or security groups.
- All sites in the organization or only some sites.
Blocking access helps provide security but comes at the cost of usability and productivity. When access is blocked, users see the following error.
![The experience when access is blocked](media/unmanaged-device-access-blocked.png)
Limiting access allows users to remain productive while addressing the risk of accidental data loss on unmanaged devices. When you limit access, users on managed devices have full access (unless they use one of the browser and operating system combinations listed in [Supported browsers](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-conditions#supported-browsers)). Users on unmanaged devices have browser-only access with no ability to download, print, or sync files. They also won't be able to access content through apps, including the Microsoft Office desktop apps. When you limit access, you can choose to allow or block editing files in the browser. When web access is limited, users see the following message at the top of sites.
![The experience when web access is limited](media/unmanaged-device-limited-web-access.png)
> [!NOTE]
> - Blocking or limiting access on unmanaged devices relies on Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies. [Learn about Microsoft Entra ID licensing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/) For an overview of conditional access in Microsoft Entra ID, see [Conditional access in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview).

As an IT admin, you can control access to SharePoint and OneDrive resources in Microsoft 365 based on defined network locations that you trust. This is also known as location-based policy.  
To do this, you define a trusted network boundary by specifying one or more authorized IP address ranges. Any user who attempts to access SharePoint and OneDrive from outside this network boundary (using web browser, desktop app, or mobile app on any device) will be blocked.  
![Access restricted message in browser](media/7efa9e14-cd9e-4369-8f24-c218c222025d.png)  
Here are some important considerations for setting a location-based policy:  
- **External sharing**: If files and folders have been shared with guests who authenticate, they will not be able to access the resources outside of the defined IP address range.     
- **Access from first and third-party apps**: Normally, a SharePoint document can be accessed from apps like Exchange, Viva Engage, Skype, Teams, Planner, Power Automate, PowerBI, Power Apps, OneNote, and so on. When a location-based policy is enabled, apps that do not support location-based policies are blocked. The only apps that currently support location-based policies are Teams, Viva Engage, and Exchange. This means that all other apps are blocked, even when these apps are hosted within the trusted network boundary. This is because SharePoint cannot determine whether a user of these apps is within the trusted boundary.    
    > [!NOTE]
    > We recommend that when a location-based policy is enabled for SharePoint, the same policy and IP address ranges should be configured for Exchange and Viva Engage. SharePoint relies on these services to enforce that the users of these apps are within the trusted IP range. For protecting access to SharePoint via the Office.com portal we recommend using the Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policy for ""Office 365"" and configuring the trusted IP range there.","[{""search_score"": 0.03177805617451668, ""reranker_score"": 2.750765562057495, ""id"": ""88307f7b98b9_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9jb250cm9sLWFjY2Vzcy1iYXNlZC1vbi1uZXR3b3JrLWxvY2F0aW9uLm1kOzM1_pages_0"", ""title"": ""control-access-based-on-network-location.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.03229166567325592, ""reranker_score"": 2.6522233486175537, ""id"": ""6b2e92ede3f0_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9jb250cm9sLWFjY2Vzcy1mcm9tLXVubWFuYWdlZC1kZXZpY2VzLm1kOzQ1_pages_0"", ""title"": ""control-access-from-unmanaged-devices.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.03177805617451668, ""reranker_score"": 2.615358352661133, ""id"": ""88307f7b98b9_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9jb250cm9sLWFjY2Vzcy1mcm9tLXVubWFuYWdlZC1kZXZpY2VzLm1kOzI1_pages_0"", ""title"": ""control-access-from-unmanaged-devices.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.0320020467042923, ""reranker_score"": 2.591963529586792, ""id"": ""6b2e92ede3f0_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9jb250cm9sLWFjY2Vzcy1mcm9tLXVubWFuYWdlZC1kZXZpY2VzLm1kOzU1_pages_0"", ""title"": ""control-access-from-unmanaged-devices.md""}, {""search_score"": 0.03159204125404358, ""reranker_score"": 2.564314842224121, ""id"": ""88307f7b98b9_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHpwejV4dmcyZWxzdmUuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2RvY3MvT2ZmaWNlRG9jcy1TaGFyZVBvaW50LXByL1NoYXJlUG9pbnQvU2hhcmVQb2ludE9ubGluZS9jb250cm9sLWFjY2Vzcy1iYXNlZC1vbi1uZXR3b3JrLWxvY2F0aW9uLm1kOzI1_pages_0"", ""title"": ""control-access-based-on-network-location.md""}]"
